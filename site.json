Accessibility is designing your product or site so that everyone can access it equally, regardless of visual impairment or other physical impairment or disability. Why should you provide accessible interfaces? Your product or site should be designed with everyone in mind. Accessibility is one of the main concerns of Liferay, therefore, Lexicon's system is designed with this in mind. Accessibility brings independence to people with disabilities. It offers the same range of possibilities to users with different physical problems. Remember that all your users are equally important. Accessibility may also be a legal requirement for your business. Some countries have strict regulations on accessibility, and they may enforce standards, which vary depending on the country, that you must follow. Some of these standards are listed below: Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) from W3C Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/designPrinciples/accessibility.md","id":"accessibility","location":"/docs/designPrinciples/accessibility.html","url":"/docs/designPrinciples/accessibility.html"},"animations":{"title":"Animations","titleLabel":"Clay","titleLabelLink":"https://clayui.com/","description":"Animations are used to transmit messages while capturing the user's attention in different ways.","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" {$page.description} Usage Lexicon provides animations that you can use in your sites and apps.

Empty collection The satellite expresses that the dataset is empty and there is nothing in the collection. Use this animation when your initial dataset is empty or a folder is empty. Empty search The telescope expresses that nothing was found. Use this animation for empty search results or empty results while applying filters over a data set. Successful empty state The spaceship taking off expresses a successful success. Use this animation when a list has been emptied that is worthy of celebration. For example, you could use this to communicate a successful state when a notifications list is emptied. Changing animations These are the default animations that Lexicon provides for Liferay products, but you can customize them to reflect your business's brand if you like.

Base Grid The Base Grid is the main metric reference of our system from which the rest of the layout structures are built. It defines the starting point of the dimensions, as well as the paddings and margins of the elements of the interface. The grid is constructed from a base 8px module, so that both the dimensions of the elements and the distances between them will always be multiples of 8: 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 â¦ This provides a common metric pattern that creates a visual coherence and consistency between the different elements of the system and their spatial relationships. This grid favors an efficient workflow, reducing the number of design decisions, as well as creating a shared visual language between designers and developers. Specifying a metric unit of 8px helps maintain visual consistency and lets you take advantage of its other benefits. There may be situations, however, where a value ââsmaller than 8px is required. The 4px unit is available for these cases. Values ââless than 8 px are primarily associated with the anatomy of the interface's basic elements, rather than specifying the distance between elements and page composition. Using Atomic Design's terminology, these minimum measurements should be used almost exclusively to define the internal anatomy of elements like atoms or molecules. They should always make sure that the block that forms the element fits the base grid of 8 px. For example, see the molecule formed below (the 4px margin) by a label and a text input, or the one formed by a label, a text input, and helper text. To learn more about the 8 px grid, see the articles listed below that have served as reference and inspiration for us to adopt this pattern: 8pt Grid Intro to The 8-Point Grid System Column System The column system is the main structural pattern for organizing and arranging elements on the page horizontally. It is not used to establish the distance between small elements, such as the icons or buttons in a toolbar, but rather it is a layout framework used to organize and establish divisions between medium and large blocks of content. Lexicon's column system is based on Bootstrap's twelve column CSS Grid, with an adjustment to the gutter to fit our base grid. The gutter of Lexicon's column system is 24px, the same value that is used throughout other basic structural references of the system. The columns are fluid, having a responsive width that conforms to the size of their parent container. The gutter's width, however, remains fixed when the viewport resizes. Vertical Rhythm The 8px base grid is also used as a baseline to determine the vertical distance between elements. When determining the vertical distance between medium and large size structural blocks of elements, such as lengthy paragraphs, however, it is better to have a greater value as a baseline. This value borrows Bootstrap's variable name: \"spacer-y\". To keep a consistent vertical rhythm, we use the main system font style's line height, 24 px, as the reference for this value. For small viewports, we can make adjustments to optimize vertical space, while still respecting the base grid. In these cases, we use the 16px spacer-y, as we do for the gutter between columns and the lateral space of the container. Although this metric may not cover all vertical space requirements, it serves as a starting point that you can adjust to meet your needs. Containers Lexicon provides two types of containers: A fixed width container and a fluid container with relative width. Fluid container This container's width is responsive to the size of the viewport. Fixed width container This container defines a maximum width. This value adjusts to the viewport's size based on predefined breakpoints. Breakpoint table The table below shows the layout system values for the different breakpoints: | Breakpoint | Device Size | Container Width | | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------- | | < 576px | Extra small devices (Portrait phones) | Auto | | &ge; 576px | Small devices (Landscape phones) | Auto | | &ge; 768px | Medium devices (Tablets) | Auto | | &ge; 992px | Large devices (Desktops) | Auto | | &ge; 1280px | Extra large devices (Large desktops) | 1248px | ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/designPrinciples/grid.md","id":"grid","location":"/docs/designPrinciples/grid.html","url":"/docs/designPrinciples/grid.html"},"typography":{"title":"Typography","titleLabel":"Clay","titleLabelLink":"https://clayui.com/docs/layout/typography.html","description":"A basic reference for the definition of the visual identity and the organization of the content.","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" {$page.description} Font Stacks Lexicon uses two text styles exclusively: A sans serif one, which is the main style, and a monospaced one used to render code. Lexicon takes an agnostic approach to typography, due to the customizable, multi-language, and multi-platform nature of Liferay's products. Therefore, Lexicon doesn't include any specific font family as part of its framework. Instead, it relies on the native font family of the user's operating system. This way we avoid web-font delivery services or font files stored on the server. Lexicon and Clay embrace the standard known as \"Native Font Stack\" as the basis for its typographic source. The tables in the sections below list the font families available for each operating system's native font stack. Sans Serif For sans serif style, using Bootstrap's native font stack as inspiration, we also include families for Ubuntu, Oxygen, and Gnome operating systems: | OS | Font Family | | -- | ----------- | | Windows | Segoe UI | | MacOS & iOS | San Francisco | | Chrome OS & Android | Roboto | | Ubuntu | Ubuntu | | OxygenOS | Oxygen | | Cantarell | Gnome | | Basic web fallbacks | Arial, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif | | Emoji Fonts | Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol | system-ui,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,\"Helvetica Neue\",Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Symbol\"; Monospaced For monospaced style, we also follow the same approach as Bootstrap: | OS | Font Family | | -- | ----------- | | Windows | Segoe UI | | MacOS & iOS | San Francisco | | Chrome OS & Android | Roboto | | Basic web fallback | Courier New, monospaced | SFMono-Regular,Menlo,Monaco,Consolas,\"Liberation Mono\",\"Courier New\",monospace; Since Mac OS is the most widely used operating system for design tasks in Liferay and in general, we have decided to use the San Francisco font family for the visual examples in both the technical documentation and in the Lexicon Site. Type Scale As we approached the foundational elements with simplification and standardization in mind, so too have we approached type scale. Lexicon's type scale is based on Bootstrap and follows one of the most widely used type scales in web products today. Lexicon's type scale is based on an initial increase of 2px that grows to 4px in larger font sizes to favor contrast and improve readability. It follows a non-linear arithmetic progression that's understandable and easy to use in both simple and complex applications. px rem example 10px 0.625rem Design matters 12px 0.75rem Design matters 14px 0.875rem Design matters 16px 1rem Design matters 18px 1.125rem Design matters 20px 1.25rem Design matters 24px 1.5rem Design matters 28px 1.75rem Design matters 32px 2rem Design matters 36px 2.25rem Design matters 40px 2.5rem Design matters Basic Formatting Line Height Lexicon uses two reference line heights for its typography: A standard line height with a 1:1.5 ratio and another one used for headings with a 1:1.25 ratio. 1:1.5 is one of the most common line height ratios used in web development right now. A body font of 16px (1rem) returns a value of 24px (1.5rem), which is the main reference measurement for the vertical organization of content in Lexicon. Using a minimum value of 1.5 for the line-height for main paragraph content also improves accessibility for people with low vision or cognitive concerns such as Dyslexia. We perceive the space between large font sizes a bit differently. The white space between lines appears more prominent. Therefore, it is considered best practice to reduce the line height in font sizes that are 20 pixels or larger. The same is true for uppercase texts. Therefore uppercase headings in Lexicon, despite only being 12px and 14px, also use a ratio of 1:1.25. | Line Height | ratio | | -- | ----------- | | Standard | 1:1.5 | | Secondary | 1:1.25 | Lexicon's Line height only applies to texts elements that run more than one line, such as paragraphs, headlines, and list group items. For the remainder of the UI elements that contain text, such as buttons, single line input fields, stickers, badges, or labels, this value is defined by the implementation. Font Weight For efficiency and simplicity, Lexicon only incorporates three font weights for content: Font Weight Reference Regular 400 Semibold 600 Bold 700 The use cases for each font weight are covered in the \"Type Styles\" section. Letter Case Lexicon uses lowercase as a basis, regardless of the specific capitalization rules. Uppercase is only used as a hierarchy resource in the section divider pattern used in dataset display views and forms. The use cases for each letter case are covered in the \"Type Styles\" section. Line Length To provide optimal reading conditions, we recommend that you use a line width within a range between 60 and 100 characters, including spacing, for medium and long text blocks. This gives a good flow to the reading and reduces the potential for straining the reader's eyes. Type styles The tables in this section show the format combinations that are available in Lexicon, along with reference examples. Headings | Font Size | Line Height | Font Weight | Letter Case | Use Example | | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | | 12px / 0.75rem | 1.25 | 600 (semibold) | Uppercase | Dataset section divider | | 14px / 0.875rem | 1.25 | 600 (semibold) | Uppercase | Form section divider | | 16px / 1rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Application and Page titles | | 20px / 1.25rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Form title | | 24px / 1.5rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Asset title in asset display widgets | | 28px / 1.75rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Blog Entry title in blogs widget | | 36px / 2.25rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Blog Entry Detail title | Paragraph | Font Size | Line Height | Font Weight | Letter Case | Use Example | | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | | 16px / 1rem | 1.5 | 400 (regular) | Lowercase | Mid-long read text | The paragraph element incorporates a bottom margin of 0.75rem (12px) to define the separation between text blocks.

Without the proper messaging for your productâs navigation and functionality, uncertainty creeps into your users minds. The messages and naming conventions you use throughout your product complement its design. No matter how well-constructed your design, poor messaging can doom your productâs effectiveness. Clarity, confidence, and consistency in messaging promotes product reliability. Be Clear Longer messaging is not always more helpful. Be concise; understand your userâs needs in a given situation, and provide them with just enough information to be successful. If an interaction is obvious, donât add messaging. A wordy product is an eyesore. Example Initiates the process If you click this button, then you will initiate a process that does something. Doing something is essential for something else. Be Confident Be bold! Take confidence in what you say! The way you provide information sets the tone for what users expect. Products that exude confidence put users at ease when making difficult decisions. Example Click this to save your work. Clicking this should save your work. Be Current Use present tense throughout product messaging. Promote the product as being alive; it helps you now, telling you what to do now. If you click a button, it wonât do something later; it accomplishes the task immediately. Example Saves the form This will save the form. Be Consistent Consistency gives users peace of mind. You want people to feel comfortable navigating your product. Surprises and uncertainty make people uncomfortable. Consistent messaging gives users freedom to focus on what theyâre doing, instead of worrying about what the product is trying to tell them. Below are two example techniques you can apply for consistent phrasing: 1. Apply Text Styles Consistently Formulate the styling you want to use in your product and stick to it. For example, you could assign styling standards to messaging types in your product (e.g., headings, instructions, checkboxes, etc.). Title: Capitalize all words (except articles, prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions) and omit any trailing punctuation. Phrase: Capitalize only the first word and all proper nouns, and omit any trailing periods (question marks allowed). Sentence: Capitalize only the first word and all proper nouns, and use normal punctuation. Tone, capitalization, and punctuation should follow a similar style on any given interface. Example 2. Address Your Users the Same Way For example, donât refer to them as we, the user, and you in the same context. Example Click the button to continue. You can select the other button at any time. Click the button so we can continue. The user can select the other button at any time. Remember, your writing style sets the tone for your product. Show people you care by guiding them with sensible, consistent messaging.

Responsive behavior On viewport sizes equal to or less than 768px, we introduce two key changes to the layout that optimize space for content: The the vertical navigation changes to a toggle top navigation, as is described in Nested navigation. The box changes from 9 to 12 columns. Attributes Example 3+8 columns (Forms) This configuration is used for forms. Form containers require less space than the 9 columns that the default layout provides, so the columns are reduced to 8. Responsive behavior Note that, to optimize space for content, the layout changes from 8 to 9 columns on viewport sizes equal to or less than 992px. Attributes Example Exceptions The 3+9 column and 3+8 column layouts cover most Lexicon interfaces. There may, however, be a few edge cases that these layouts don't cover: Scenario 1: A 3+9 columns configuration turns into 2+10 columns configuration. Scenario 2: A 3+8 columns configuration turns into 2+9 columns configuration. These scenarios are only desirable when two columns is enough for the sidebar's width. You may want to consider these configurations, If the points shown below are true for your UI: You have really short vertical navigation titles across all languages that your site manages. You have more space in the main box to fit a table with many columns. If you use these configurations, make sure you apply two columns for the sidebar in all application sections for consistency.","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/designPrinciples/layout/layoutSidebar.md","id":"layoutSidebar","location":"/docs/designPrinciples/layout/layoutSidebar.html","url":"/docs/designPrinciples/layout/layoutSidebar.html"}},"childIds":["layoutFull","layoutCards","layoutForm","layoutSidebar"]}},"title":"Foundations","description":"Keep updated.","layout":"guide","icon":"lexicon-site-principles","weight":2,"content":"","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/designPrinciples/index.md","id":"designPrinciples","location":"/docs/designPrinciples/","url":"/docs/designPrinciples/","childIds":["accessibility","animations","colors","grid","layout","typography","writingstyle"]},"examples":{"children":{"assetMetricsDashboard":{"title":"Asset Metrics Dashboard","titleProject":"ANALYTICS CLOUD","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" Rafael Fernandes UX Designer, Recife Liferay Analytics Cloud provides the ability to analyze user profile data and interactions with dynamic pages and assets, displaying meaningful insights in the form of chart dashboards.

It is a guide to foundations, components, patterns, and use cases that provide consistency and coherence to these products, and, ultimately, provides a satisfactory and unified experience to its users. Lexicon is a living project, evolving and adapting over time to new and rising technologies to meet the needs of the people. Modular approach Lexicon takes a modular approach to interface design. It is a cohesive system that's able to respond to the various needs of Liferay's products through a base set of components. It seeks to simplify processes, reduce production times, and above all, to provide a consistent user experience across the board. To achieve this goal, Lexicon uses Brad Frost's Atomic Design approach to interface design: A work methodology, based on modularity, that seeks to give a more hierarchical and organized structure to the creation of interface design systems. It's a nonlinear process, organized across five stages: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages. Lexicon site This site explains the design specs and proper usage of Lexicon's system of components for designers, developers, and overall digital creators. While it is primarily for the Liferay community, it is open to anyone who wants to use its components or make contributions or suggestions to improving it. Foundations These are the principles that the design system is built on. Modifications to these principles affect the component's behavior. These include foundational elements such as colors, grid, and typography. Core Components This section contains the common components that are essential to build interfaces. Each component defines its rules and behaviors. Each component's look and feel is based on the combination of the foundations mentioned above. Therefore, changes to the foundation principles propagate to the entire system. In our case, these components are implemented by Clay. Satellite Components These components are for the needs of specific products or applications. They are built using Lexicon's foundations and core components. They belong to the product or application that created them, rather than the design system itself. Templates Templates offer prebuilt solutions to tackle repetitive interface challenges. They speed up the design process, as they only require minor modifications to fit your use case and display your content. Examples This section showcases practical designs by UX Designers that demonstrate how core components and satellite components are applied to create Lexicon interfaces that tackle specific scenarios. The components in this site include the labels shown below, which indicate if the component links to its implementation or the product where you can find them. This lets you view the components in a real-world application and context. | Label | Usage | | ---- | ----- | | VIEW IN CLAY | Links to the pattern implementation | | PRODUCT NAME | The pattern is used in a concrete product or application | | PENDING | The pattern has been designed and will be implemented either in Clay or a Product/Application. | Implement Lexicon Lexicon is not an implementation. It is a set of patterns, rules, and behaviors that any library can implement. Liferay's Lexicon Experience Language web implementation is Clay.","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/lexicon/index.md","id":"lexicon","location":"/docs/lexicon/","url":"/docs/lexicon/"},"news":{"children":{"News":{"title":"News","description":"Keep updated.","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" January 2nd, 2019 New components We have new components to share with you: Color picker Date and Time picker You will find them out soon in our Figma Library and in Clay. November 12th, 2018 General update Drag and drop pattern definition where you can find the styles and examples. Resources: DEVCON 2018 presentation link and links to blog posts made by Lexicon Team. October 13th, 2018 General update Examples: As promised, we are updating the examples section. This time we bring you an example from Liferay Partner Portal submitted by Patrick Pentz. Dropdown menu: Dropdown menu definition has been updated to accept icons on the left side of actions. Tabs: Tabs have been updated with an example to give context in tab bars. October 12th, 2018 Management bar update We are happy to announce that we have a new update for the Management Toolbar. The Toolbar is now able to contextualize actions based on the selection in the dataset. This reduces the number of potential errors by narrowing the actions down to only the ones that are relevant to the selected elements. Moreover, we introduce the results bar when filters are applied and/or search is performed from the Management Toolbar. This provides the user with useful and visible feedback. October 4th, 2018 Examples Lexicon can be used to create many different interfaces. Today, we open a new \"Examples\" section in our site to showcase different Lexicon interface examples created by Liferay UX designers for our products. We hope these series of examples inspire you and give you an idea of the possible interfaces you can create. These examples will grow over time to showcase a wide variety of interfaces built with Lexicon. August 21st, 2018 New organization Components are now organized into two key groups: Core and Satellite. Core components are the basic components that are widely used by Liferay products. Satellite components are the remaining components that are not used that often in many Liferay products. Although these components are not as widely used, they can save you time from reinventing the wheel. Note: that core components are implemented and supported by Clay, while satellite components are not supported. We have also created a Templates section that includes the most common templates created with Lexicon components in Liferay products. August 21st, 2018 Predictive Forecast Chart Predicitive Forecast Chart has been documented inside the charts section. This chart is very useful for commerce data. June 27th, 2018 Stable version We also want to highlight the improvements made since the last release: The site has now uses the system font like we do in Lexicon. All images have been changed from Source Sans Pro to San Francisco (system font for MacOS) A large number of patterns now include attribute sections that describe the pattern's anatomy. Examples have been added to many of our patterns, and the descriptions have been updated. Moreover, now you can find our sketch library under resources section to build your own interfaces using Lexicon. April 24th, 2018 Beta release We are glad to announce that we are in beta right now. We will update style changes before leaving beta status. April 20th, 2018 General Update This update comes with many small updates that improve communication: Charts: base layer interaction and different chart examples Forms: reorganized for better understanding Animations: pending, but an introduction is there as reference Labels: patterns have been labeled to specify if they are implemented by Clay or if they are owned by another team/application. Status table: specifies the design and implementation status for each component's page January 17th, 2018 General Update This update comes with many small updates that improve communication: Dos and Don'ts have been included for the following patterns: badges, labels, table, actions definition, and popover. This helps clarify the proper usage of each pattern. Multiple step form now includes an example that demonstrates how to use the pattern. Text input localizable has been released. Card layout has been added to the Layout section under the Foundation heading. Vertical navigation now includes an example of a collapsible menu on mobile. Sidebar documentation has been organized into several areas of focus. January 8th, 2018 Examples Examples, along with images demonstrating the proper usage, have been added to the table page to clarify the row hover action. Multistep form has also been updated with a layout example in a form to better illustrate how to use it. Finally, checkbox group and radio group examples, along with metrics, have been added. January 3rd, 2018 Sites A full set of components is available in the sites section for you to use to build your own site widgets. This lets you transform old widgets, by bringing them new life with a better information architecture, structure, and a refreshing design. November 28th, 2017 Layouts and Form Hierarchy As part of the improvement in Lexicon, we want to clearly define the different layout possibilities that you'll usually find in admin pages. Layout is one of the foundation principles that is key to building interfaces with our system. We've add a dedicated page for form hierarchy to better define the form pattern. The Forms section now also includes a Slider section. November 20th, 2017 Charts and Sites Charts and Sites have been documented at their initial stage. Charts are a completely new pattern in Lexicon. We want to provide a full set of principles for it to improve accessibility, perception, and interpretation. Sites tackles widgets for sites. Lexicon faces a huge improvement in this area towards improving not only the visual aspect, but also the usability in some of our ADTs. Many improvements will come in the near future in this area as the next portal release date grows closer. November 13th, 2017 Updates Liferay is happy to announce a new alpha version of Lexicon. The alpha version brings a wider range of possibilities, new components, and a brand new color palette. Lexicon now focuses on accessibility, shorter interactions, and ways to achieve a better user experience never before seen in Liferay. This alpha version will transition to beta as soon as Lexicon and Clay align.","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/news/News.md","id":"News","location":"/docs/news/News.html","url":"/docs/news/News.html"},"status":{"title":"Status","description":"Lexicon upcoming site status","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" Last Update January 2nd, 2019 | Legend | | ---- | | &#9679;

The status icon and the keyword that defines the message type for the alert must be semi-bold. Alerts can have multiple text lines. Alerts can contain links. These links are defined in primary color. Toast and stripe alerts can be temporary. The delay times for these temporary alerts to disappear are shown below: 10 sec if there are actions associated. 5 sec if there are no actions associated. In both cases, the time freezes on hover to allow the user more time to interact with the alert message. On mouse out, the countdown continues. Types | Type | Usage | | ----- | ----- | | Error | The error alert is Red. It indicates that something went wrong after performing an action. (E.g.: The form couldnât be saved because some data was missing) | | Success | The success alert is Green. It appears when the action is successful. (E.g.: The user was created successfully). | | Warning | The warning alert is Yellow. It lets users know that the action was completed, but there are some issues with it. (E.g. The item was created but with some issues). | | Information | The information alert is Blue. It provides relevant information while a user carries out a task. | See the colors page to learn more about color definitions. Attributes An alert has 4 different attributes: The status icon The type text The description text The close button. This may not appear, depending on the alert's use. The image below shows the metrics for an alert's design: Variations Toast This type of alert must appear at the bottom left side of the screen. There must be a 24px separation from the left and from the bottom. If the alert is temporary, it will disappear in 10 seconds. An example is shown below: Embedded Embedded alerts are meant for use in forms. Usually you will only need to use the information one.

Badges don't always indicate the exact number of elements. When this is the case, please use plain text instead. Badges work for exact numbers up to 999. For numbers greater than 999, use K to indicate Thousands (5K for 5.231) and M to indicate Millions (2M for 2.100.523). The Red badge is only used for the cases below: Notifications: These are always placed nearby a user profile or a Product menu option. Errors: These are used in tables and lists.

Two primary actions can't be near each other. Secondary The secondary button is always use for secondary actions. Several secondary actions can be near by each other. Link The link button is mainly used for Cancel actions. States Default state Hover state Active state Disable state Sizes Default The default size is a height of 40px. It is used for main page actions such as Save or Cancel. Small The small size is a height of 32px. It is used for actions inside a page, such as dropdowns, button groups, and split buttons. Dos and Don'ts Use the same height for all the buttons that are in the same row. Do Don't Characters can not all be uppercase in a button. Do Don't Text can not wrap multiple lines. It must all be on one line. Do Don't A borderless button must be placed either before or after a set of bordered buttons. Do Don't Variations Secondary borderless A secondary borderless button is used in toolbars when a secondary button would be too heavy for the toolbar's design. This keeps the design clean. Icon button Buttons can display icons instead of text. The icons, however, must be monospaced inside the button. Icon buttons are used primarily in management bars. This button variation can be primary, secondary, or borderless type. Icon and text button This button type is only used in sites, outside of administration. The icon emphasizes and helps communicate the action. The label must match the icon's purpose. Block level button Buttons can also be configured at block level. Use this configuration when you need to communicate that an important action is required for the user. For example, it can be used as a load more action below a list. Please do not use it in forms. Choose the button type carefully. Primary is not always the best choice, nor is it the only configuration. Dropdown button Dropdown buttons are always used with a dropdown menu. This button variation can be secondary or borderless type. Split button Split buttons are used when you need to offer the user a quick main action along with secondary actions. Button group Button groups are used to switch between complementary views for example, but they must never be used for complementary actions, \"Change and Cancel\" actions, or \"Save and Cancel\" actions. In those cases, single buttons are the correct solution. Plus button Plus buttons provide add actions for a dataset and are normally placed in toolbars. The add button lets you add entities, such as a blog post for a blog, a message board thread for a message board, or a folder. It can have one action or multiple.

A practical use case for this could be your users database or an image library. Cards are meant for a light comparison of information rather than an exhaustive comparison. If you have exhaustive information to compare, which doesn't contain images, use a table instead. Cards can have various configurations. We provide a flexible card layout that is fully customizable, so you can create the UI you need. See the example configurations throughout this page to get inspired. Card interaction A card can have a checkbox, a radio button, or neither of them. You can select a card by using the checkbox or radio button or the image area. The main text in the card can be used for navigation: When used in a Folder card, it navigates to the next level. When used in a File, Image, or User card, it navigates to its detail view. Never use the navigation to view a preview. This is always a secondary action placed inside the action menu. If the link drives the user out of the site, please identify visually that this link will open in a new page. Layout By providing a flexible layout, Lexicon gives you a wider range of possible configurations for your card. You can adapt the layout to suite your needs, so it just contain the elements you require. A card contains the following elements: The image area: The main element in this pattern. It has a 16:9 aspect ratio. Checkbox or radio: This is useful when working together as a visualization type with a management bar. Sticker or User image: This is useful to identify the file type or the owner. An information area Informative text: This contains relevant information, such as the description. Actions menu: This contains actions associated with the card. The only required element for a card is the image. Everything else can be removed. Image card Image cards are used in image/document galleries. Default Hover Active Empty Image with different ratios Images can vary in size. So no visual information is lost in the card, Lexicon maintains the original images aspect ratio within the image area's container. Attributes Checkbox Image Sticker: file type Title Actions button Detail or short descriptive text Label: status identifier User card User cards represent users. The user can be represented by their user image or up to two initials extracted from their user name or name + surname. File card File cards represent files other than images. Folder card Folder cards display horizontal representations of information. They have the same amount of elements as the other cards previously explained on this page. The main purpose of this card is to represent folders, therefore the image is removed in this card type. In this case, only the checkbox is used to select. Sections Card sections organize content into separate divisions by a certain categorization or typology. Examples See the dataset template for a practical use case of cards.

There are two main use cases to consider: A risk action: The action the user is going to perform has significant consequences that can't be undone or easily undone. Ex: site deletion. An unintended consequence: The action the user is taking has notable side effects that may leave them feeling disoriented. Ex: a site switch that results in a complete change of context, including user permissions. Confirmation messages are rarely needed and should only be used when they fall under one of the two cases mentioned above. When must not use it Providing extremely clear feedback can prevent the need for confirmation messages. Do not use a confirmation message for the following cases: Error prevention: The interface should clearly communicate its intended use, thus preventing the need for a confirmation message to communicate potential errors. Undo actions: If an action has an undo action, you must never use a confirmation message to proceed with the action. A clear example is âMove to Recycle Binâ. Unless a confirmation message is absolutely required, as explained in the previous section, do not use one. How to write a confirmation message Your confirmation message must clearly communicate the situation and the potential results of proceeding with the action. An unclear message can result in the user mistakenly taking irreversible actions or finding themselves in an unexpected situation. Follow these guidelines to write a good confirmation message: Do not write generic and open questions. Ex: Are you sure? Be clear and concise. Provide exact information to your user, so there is no uncertainty on the action to be confirmed. Address your questions and statements so they can be easily answered with \"Ok\" and \"Cancel\", as they are provided by the browser. Implementation Confirmation messages are browser native. Therefore, Lexicon does not style them. Browser native confirmation messages are accessible and work perfectly on every device.

The most common visualization types used are table, list, and card. You can see the dataset display pattern in action in the slides below: Previous Next Usage This pattern is used when the visualization elements require collective management. The management bar offers the tools you need to work with the dataset. This pattern can only be used once on a page. Use it if you want several visualization options for a set of data. Use it if you want to perform actions on an individual piece of data or a set of data. Only use the visualization options that you require for your data. A visualization option may not be appropriate for your data. Use a list view If you need to display homogeneous sets of basic data. If you need to sort, group, or filter simple data sets. If you donât need to compare attributes of different items. If you need to display a single-level hierarchy. If you need to be able to quickly identify the content of a list item. Use a table view If you need to manage complex data sets that need to be extensively sorted, grouped, filtered, or edited. If you need to compare attributes of different items. If you work with complex hierarchies. Use a grid view If the primary content consists of images. Use of other visualization methods So far the common use cases have been covered, but other visualization methods are possible, such as map view. Since they are not commonly used, you must implement them yourself. Empty state It's important to let the user know how and why an empty state is displayed, as well as what actions they can take to move out from the empty state. See the empty states page for more information. Individual actions Individual actions are always available through an element's actions menu. Some of these actions are contextual and only appear in the management bar when one or more elements are selected from the dataset. These contextual actions are always represented by a button with an icon. They should only be the actions that are most relevant to the selected element(s). Collective actions Collective actions are shown in the management bar when more than one element is selected in the dataset. If a collective action doesn't have an icon associated with it, it can be placed in a dropdown triggered from the actions button in the management bar. Filtering Only use filters when you need them. When a filter is chosen from the management bar for a view type, the view type must update the displayed data to reflect the requested filter. Only elements that are displayed can be filtered. Hidden elements are not included in filtered results. When a filter returns an empty result, the user must be able to select another filter to keep the management bar from becoming locked. Always offer a descriptive message that clearly communicates that the dataset is empty or no results were found for the search. Sorting When sorting is applied from the management bar for a view type, the view type must update the displayed data to reflect the requested sorting option. Only elements that are displayed can be filtered. Hidden elements are not included in filtered results. Tables can display the current sorting option in the column header. To provide this feature, make the following updates: When the user sorts by the column header, the value must be marked on the sort panel, and the arrow must indicate the âsort directionâ. When the user sorts by the sort panel and button, the action must be reflected in the appropriate column header. Selection When an item is selected in any of the views, the management bar must change to its second state. This state is indicated by a different background color. The number of actions adapt to the number of items selected in the view: When one item is selected, the available actions are the same as in the row. When multiple items are selected, the available group actions are displayed. The checkbox in the management bar selects/unselects all elements in the view. Drag and drop example Change view Only provide multiple view options if more than one visualization method is available for a data set. visualization methods that are not available for a data set must not be available as a view option.

This can optionally perform an action, depending on the target the element is dropped onto.","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" {$page.description} Events Drag and drop interaction is composed of a series of six events: DragStart: An element starts to drag when it is clicked or Tapped on while holding and Moving the pointer. Drag: The element is being dragged. DragLeave: The element leaves its original position or a valid target. DragEnter: The element enters a valid drop target. Drop: The element is released. DragEnd: The element has completed the drag and drop interaction. It is successful if it matches the conditions for a drop target. Actors The drag and drop interaction involves the following actors: Pointer Although a standard element, you must consider the type of mouse pointer you use during dragging and dropping. Please follow these guidelines: | Type | Usage | | --- | ---- | | | Default: the standard mouse cursor. | | | Open hand: used during the hover state of an element when it is possible to move it around, but selection is not allowed (e.g. a map or a zoomed image) | | | Dragging: always required as feedback for the dragging action when using a mouse | Handler It can be hard to distinguish a draggable element from a standard element in the interface. To properly communicate that an element is draggable to the user, we recommend that you use the drag-dots icon in the element on hover. A good example is a list of draggable items: Drag Element & Drag Feedback Elements that are draggable must also offer feedback when they are being dragged. There are a couple scenarios to consider: Scale down the item while dragging a single element When dragging a single element, the element must be scaled down to 70% and accompany the cursor as shown in the image below: Multiple elements dragging When dragging multiple elements, you may need to indicate how many elements are being dragged. For that we offer a badge to reflect this amount. Please remember the following while dragging multiple elements: The badge must always be placed at the top-right from the cursor. Multiple selections are previewed together while grabbing the elements and moving them. Drag Source The drag source indicates the original position of the dragged element. It is only visible when the element is being dragged away from its original position (event: DragLeave). There are two variants for showing feedback in the dragged element's source: Default: setting its opacity to 40%, as shown in the image below. Simplified placeholder: For cases that require a simpler approach, you can use a placeholder that is the same size as the element. Transform the element's background color to #272833 with a 4% opacity. This may require modification depending on the use case. Valid Target A valid target is the possible drop area of a dragged element. An element can have multiple valid targets on the same page. A valid target changes appearance, depending on the event: Default: No interaction A valid target is initially indicated with a grey background and a grey dashed border. This can be used in scenarios where files need to be dragged. Please use text inside to valid target to improve readability. DragEnter: Dragging Interaction Dragging an element into a valid target area activates the target area. When a target is activated, the border line style must remain the same and it must be turned blue, as shown in the image below: Drop and DropEnd: Dropping Result After dropping an element inside a valid target, the Drop and DropEnd event is triggered. Cards sorting example You can use the Drop/DragEnd event to magnetize the dragged element to the target. This improves the accuracy of the drag and drop action when the element changes position in the same page. Moving elements to a folder example Moving an element into another element to change its location (like a folder) will trigger an animation with a border that expands and hides. This indicates that the dropped element was moved. We also recommend that you show a success alert after the action is done. This will communicate that the elements were moved correctly and also give the user the possibility to undo the action, via a link. Sorting list items example Another way to define a valid target is to use a blue line of 4px between the elements. We recommend that you use fluid animations to provide a more natural feedback of moving elements.

This mechanism organizes these options into a condensed menu, keeping the screen clean and making their intention more implicit. Dropdowns are usually triggered from a dropdown button or a button with an icon. These are the two most common implementations in Lexicon. To close a dropdown, use one of the following methods: Select an option in the panel, if they are mutually exclusive. Click on the button that triggered it. Click outside the panel. Dropdowns have a maximum width of 240px. When an option's text doesn't fit into the available space, use two lines. The text for each option should be short and specific enough to be able to fit on one line if possible. The maximum height is 500px for desktop and 400px on mobile devices. Vertical scroll is allowed when the content exceeds the limit. The distance between the trigger button and the dropdown must be 8px. Types Default The default dropdown is a panel that doesn't support scrolling for the content inside it. Use the default configuration when you have a small number of options or when the panel is big enough to contain all the elements you want to use. Dropdown with dividers Use a dropdown menu with dividers to keeps actions organized in an actions menu. Organizing the actions by context of use makes it easier for users to find them. Dropdown with checkbox or radio Dropdowns can be configured to have checkboxes and/or radio groups. You can use checkboxes to filter dataset elements, while a radio can be useful for ordering the criteria in a dataset. Dropdown with search field Action menus can sometimes contain multiple elements, making it a little time consuming to scroll through the entire list of options. In these cases, you can add a search field to your dropdown menu so your users can quickly find the action and move on to their next task. Dropdown with icons on the left Dropdown menus with icons on the left are suitable for process bars (wizards), when the number of steps do not fit the screen. This configuration can display the remaining steps. This configuration is also suitable to help quickly identify an actions menu item with an icon that closely relates to it. Dropdown with icons on the right Dropdown menus with icons on the right are suitable for process bars (wizards) when the number of steps do not fit the screen. It displays the remaining steps and emphasizes the step number by placing the icon on the right side. Dropdown with groups This dropdown menu variation is for use with the management bar Filter and Order dropdown button. This configuration is used to refine the management bar UI options, providing the user with more specific mechanisms to find data. Buttons in dropdown groups can either be primary or secondary, depending on the application needs. Sorting actions Dropdown menu from actions button Below is a list of guidelines for creating actions menus. Note that not all of these guidelines are always required: Order by context (use a separator line between each of the groups): Primary commands: edit, preview, open, etc. Secondary commands specific to the object: expire, view history, etc. Transfer commands: copy, duplicate, move, export, import, etc. Object settings: permissions, configuration, etc. Object commands: delete, move to the recycle bin, etc. General rules Group size must be less than or equal to seven. The total number of elements must not exceed 15 items. Use separator lines between groups. Do not increase the menu complexity with submenus. Groups must be ordered by frequency of use. For items inside a group, use alphabetical order. Disabling actions: If an action is not available for an item due to its state, disable it. Only remove an action if the item by nature can't perform the action. Use icons to help identify actions. Complementary actions must work together (Ex: Lock, Unlock) When one is available, the complementary action must be disabled. In some cases both actions may be available at the same time (Ex: undo / redo) Only present the actions that make sense in the context. Do not overload the menu. This doesn't mean to remove disabled items. Dropdown menu from Plus button Plus button's can contain multiple actions. When this is the case, these actions are displayed in a dropdown menu. Users can customize a list of favorites in the plus button's dropdown menu, as shown in the message in the image on the left. This is available via a modal window that is triggered by the More button at the bottom. An example configuration is shown in the image on the right. Note: The default behaviour of the More button is to load more items in the dropdown menu, but it is not the desired one. Favorites are ordered using the following rules: Out of the favorites the order is ruled as follows: The first two elements are the most used ones. The remaining favorites are displayed in alphabetical order Dropdown menus for plus buttons can also contain scrollbars to view a long list of items, as shown in the image below. When creating dropdown menus for plus buttons, please follow the guidelines shown below: The menu must be split into two main areas: Primary actions: always contains the generic actions. Example: folder. Secondary actions: contains actions that fit a certain category. Example: structures, document types, etc. Secondary organization: The first group should contain favorites if they exist. The second group should contain the remaining actions. Display a maximum of seven actions between favorites and not favorites. Display a message that shows the total number of actions inside the category. Example: âShowing 7 of 203 itemsâ Include a More area to give access to the modal that contains the rest of the items and lets the user customize the list of favorites. Sorting inside each group: Place the most used item first. Place the remaining items in alphabetical order. The dropdown menu can't exceed 15 actions.

There are three default animations available to communicate empty states. The scenario for each empty state and animation is shown below: Empty dataset: There are no elements in the data set at a certain level Empty search results: The filters or search results return zero results. Empty state for success: The user has emptied the dataset for a good cause. For example, all the notifications have been addressed, resulting in a clean state. When not to use an animation Animations are used to catch the user's attention, therefore they should only appear once on the screen. In our case, we use these animations in the components that are usually the center of attention and receive the most focus. In less common components, we prefer to avoid the animation and be more discrete. Attributes Inside a dataset display These attributes are used for an animation: Animation Text: limited to one line Message: limited, but we recommend to use a maximum of 30 words Do not make messages personal, unless they are preferable for the context. Do not leave one word alone on a line. Do not use \"your\". Do not use exclamation marks. Use common language and not jargon. Button: secondary button The margin from the container to the top element is 80px. Outside a dataset display Animations shouldn't be used outside a dataset display. In these cases, use a primary button to catch the user's attention. The primary button has these attributes: Text: limited to one line Message: This follows the same rules as an animation's message.

The icon itself helps to communicate an idea but the meaning must be given by the label. The icon is just a visual aid. Please choose carefully the icon and the associated label so together they have a powerful and not misleading meaning. Using an icon to communicate a concept is not always easy. If you are in this situation consider just using text. Size usage for designers Use a 16px box for icons of 16px. Size usage for developers Lexicon icons have no size. The size of the icon is established by its container. The default container size is 16px. The available icons to use are in the Lexicon Icon Library. Don't mix these icons with icons from outside this library. If Lexicon doesn't provide the icons you need, switch icon libraries completely. Liferay icon library Liferay has its own icon library created for the purposes of the projects that use Lexicon. {foreach $icon in $page.icons} {$icon} {/foreach} Please, follow this guide to create icons for Lexicon. Language flags People tend to have pretty strong opinions on whether flags should be used as a visual cue for indicating a language. This is because in many parts of the world the flag may have cultural and geographic meanings that we might not be aware of, or the flag itself may not be fully accurate to the dialects spoken in that region. While we understand this reasoning, we've found that when a user is not familiar with the currently displayed language, flags somewhat eliminate the use of other mechanisms, such as the name of the language (since the current language could be in an entirely different character set). Given this, there is often at least some familiarity with the identity of a country that speaks a shared language. {foreach $flag in $page.flags} {$page.flagData[$flag]} ({$flag}) {/foreach} Other

It's useful for comparing entries that don't require exhaustive comparison. If the dataset requires exhaustive comparison between entries, use the table view instead. When a list is used together with a management bar, the list entries must include a checkbox, as the selection and actions are reflected in the management bar. Lists support several text labels in a column, as shown in the examples below. Row states Default states Hover state Selected state Row interactions A list entry can have a checkbox, a radio or none of them. You can select a row by using the checkbox or radio button, depending on the selection type in the list. The background is not selectable. You can add links to a row to navigate to other areas. A row can have related actions. If there is only one action for the row that can be represented by an icon, you don't need to use an actions menu. Otherwise, include a actions menu on the right side of the row. Use the main text as an action for the following use cases: A Folder that navigates to the next level A File that navigates to its detailed view Never use the row action to view a preview. This is always a secondary action placed inside the row's action menu. Content format and alignment The Main text must always be semi bold. To favor legibility, the width of the main content wonât go further than 50% of the row's width on wide screens. Inside the main content group, there wonât be more than three elements stacked. The row, however, can grow vertically, if the elements need more vertical space. It will never exceed more than two lines. Short descriptions are aligned on the right side of the main content and extend until the tools. These descriptions are not more than two lines long. Text elements canât fill more than two lines. If text elements exceed two lines, an ellipsis is used for the remaining text. Sections List sections organize content into separate divisions by a certain categorization or typology. Examples See the dataset template for more examples of lists. Responsive Text elements can't fill more than two lines. When the entire content for a list can't be displayed, for instance on a smaller screen, it will be replaced with an ellipsis. If a list row contains tags, they canât occupy more than one line. If a tag's row is longer, use an ellipsis. Notifications PORTAL If a list entry needs support for notifications, place an 8px width line on the left side of the row.

We recommend that you do not use the full-width size, as it appears as though it's a completely new page. If you require this size, we recommend that you consider creating a new page instead of a modal. Modals belong to a screen, therefore a modal should not be triggered from another modal window (see the Modal over modal section below). When a modal has a footer, place the actions inside and align them to the left. Follow this order for your actions: Primary button (only one), secondary button, and button link. Dos Don'ts Use it to draw the user's attention to something that is more important. Do not use it for complex cases that require you to display a lot of information or to complete a long form. In these cases, use a new page instead. Use it for simple content cases. Try not to trigger a modal window from another modal window. Modal windows are subordinate to pages. Use it if you need to interrupt the user flow to display concrete information or capture data from the user. Never completely cover the page's information with the modal window. Multiple selection inside a modal Selecting multiple items in a modal must be done by selecting each desired element through the checkbox. The selection will be finished by clicking in Done button at the modal footer. Single selection inside a modal Single selection must be done by clicking directly on the desired element. In this case, the element must not have a Choose or Select button. The modal doesn't have footer as there is no need. Modal over modal Modal over modal is a not desired situation. Please, try to solve this situation in another way, like using a full page or driving the process to the correct place. In case this happens, make sure to provide a good experience preventing first modal closing by accidental interaction (as an example). Size Modals are always displayed at the center of the screen and can be configured with the sizes shown in the table below: | Size | Description | | ---- | ----- | | Small | 320px | | Default | 600px | | Large | 896px wide modal on screen sizes greater than 992px. 600px wide modal on screen sizes between 768px and 992px. | | Full width | A modal that stretches to fit the browser window, with 45px padding on every side. | Attributes Modal header Title Close button Body Content: form, text, image... Footer Modal buttons Configurations Lexicon allows your modal window to have different configurations related to your needs. These needs vary from case to case and that is why not every modal in the system needs to be equal, but needs to follow certain rules. Header, body and footer This is the classic composition of a modal window with its three main parts: header, body, and footer. Header and body This configuration is used when you don't need a footer bar to place your icons. Body and Footer Use this configuration when you just need to show text and buttons to agree or cancel. iframe in the body You can of course add an iframe to a modal body at any time. See the iframe modal body Clay section for more information. Modal overlay color The modal overlay color is a main lighten 8% color with an alpha value of 0.8. Modals for status messages Modal headers can be configured to use modals as status messages. This solution is proposed to give more emphasis on blocking actions that the use must read and pay careful attention. Never remove the icon in the title, as it provides the modal with a better user experience for accessibility. Always use direct and concrete titles. Mobile When a modal is viewed on a mobile device, its look and feel transforms to the one shown below to provide a mobile friendly user experience. The modal occupies the whole screen, drawing the user's attention.

Lexicon provides a specific color order and combinations and rules to follow when you create a new chart component, including patterns, dash lines, and shapes. Flat Colors Gradient Colors Use gradient colors when you donât need a chart with embedded texts, but instead you need visual variation between shapes (an example could be a Heat Map). Use of Gradient Colors An example use case for gradient colors could be a low/high level Map with different data for every country, with a maximum of nine levels of differentiation. Rules for Gradient Colors You can get the same percentages we applied to the âStarkâ blue for each one of the Flat Colors by using a sass color generator. Paste the Flat Color HEX, and youâll get the percentages. This provides you with a set of colors that you can use as gradient colors. Reading colors Colors help identify data and improve readability, but they must be chosen carefully. Choosing the wrong colors can produce the opposite effect. Below are some guidelines for choosing colors are shown below. Shape & order Using the proper shape and color order helps avoid color vibration and lets users, including color blind users, easily identify chart sections. A pie chart example is shown below: Do Don't Lines Charts Only use borders, 2px thickness, to identify line charts. Differentiate them using dash types, shape types, and colors. Donât use background/area colors with line charts, as they will only confuse the user. Area Charts Background colors may be necessary to identify Area Charts. We recommend that you use 10% opacity for each Area Chart's background color. This lets area colors overlap, without completely obscuring each other. Use the same elements as Line Charts for borders and shapes. Colors on chart interaction For clarity and to provide a good user experience, you should let the user interact and focus on single chart elements. The example below resizes the selected element (from the pie or the legend) and highlights it by decreasing the opacity of the other elements to 40%: The example below styles a Line chart to improve readability. The selected element maintains the 2px border, while the other elements are decreased to a 1px border and 40% opacity: Text embedded in area Although, you can include text inside the Flat Colors by default, we don't recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you use organization and interaction to improve text readability. The best place for this is the legend. Accessibility Lexicon provides a set of elements that you can use to improve accessibility in your charts. These are covered in more detail below. Lines and Shapes Lines and shapes can help you create easily recognizable patterns in line charts. You can see both elements in action in the example below: Area patterns You can use patterns in areas to help identify each section.

Interaction items Chart item This can be a bar inside a Bar Chart, a pie slice in a Pie Chart, etc. The popover must show information related to this specific item. The popover must be shown on top of the chart item. Highlight the legend item (font weight to semi-bold). This clearly communicates the relationship between the chart element and its corresponding legend value. Chart item inside a group We don't differentiate between grouped items and stand alone items. When a user interacts with an item in a set of items, the behavior is the same as a Chart Item. Axis item The popover must show information related to all the elements in that axis row or column. This information can either be global information, like a number, or an information breakdown. The popover must be shown next to the axis item without hovering the chart. Sometimes there will only be one axis. Sometimes the chart will not provide interaction on both axis. This is perfectly normal. Example: Vertical stacked bar An interaction in the x-axis item will show a popover with information for each of the items. An interaction in the y-axis item will show nothing.

Cancel: discards the changes and enters view mode. Example Attributes An editable row can contain the same elements as a standard table row. An inline editable table includes these attributes: Checkbox. Main column text. Other columns, in which different components may appear. Edit button. Actions button.

Tables display text heavily. If you need to display images, we recommend that you use lists or cards. A table entry or row doesn't support two different data types in the same column. The is due to potential comparison and sorting problems. When a table is used together with the management toolbar, the table entries must include a checkbox since the selection and actions are reflected in the management toolbar. See the dataset display for examples. Tables contain the following attributes (labeled in the image above): Table header Section Row Row interaction Table header Column headers are always left-aligned, 14px, and have regular weight. The table header can have these interactive attributes: Sorting (if available): the column header has an arrow next to it indicating the sort direction: A-z (down arrow) and Z-a (up arrow). The text is underlined on hover state. Drag & drop (if available): the column header shows a drag-icon on hover state. Table header attributes Tables headers contain the following attributes (labeled in the image above): Selected column Sort direction icon Remaining columns Sections You can use the table group separator to group a series of table entries. Row states Default state Hover state When a user hovers over a table row, quick actions from the actions menu are displayed for the element. A maximum of three actions (represented by icons) can appear. When the row is selected, the actions do not appear on hover state. Selected state Row attributes Table rows contain the following attributes (labeled in the image above): Checkbox Main column text Columns Actions button Table rows on hover contain the following attributes (labeled in the image above): Checkbox Main column text Columns Actions button Quick actions displayed on row hover Row interactions A table entry can have a checkbox, a radio button, or neither of them. You can select a row by using the checkbox or radio button, depending on the selection type in the list. The background is not selectable. You can add links to a row to navigate to other areas. A row can have related actions. If there is only one action for the row that can be represented by an icon, you don't need to use an actions menu. Otherwise, include an actions menu on the right side of the row. Use the main text as an action for the following use cases: A Folder that navigates to the next level A File that navigates to its detailed view Never use the row action to view a preview. This is always a secondary action placed inside the row's action menu. If the link drives the user out of the site, please identify visually that this link will open in a new page. A cell entry can include a button as the main action of a table entry. An example could be \"Execute\". You can drag and drop selected elements into a folder. A click and drag over a non selected element implies selection. Row hover Row Interaction Limitation Note that the actions menu has a limitation on the hover state. It is not possible to have a row with a button in the default state because it would be impossible to click on it while the actions menu is active in the hover state. Dos and Don'ts Never hide an action in the table since both static actions in the row and quick actions are not compatible. Quick actions will always hover an action placed in the table row and it will be impossible to reach, as shown for the \"Edit\" button in the example below. Do Don't Columns drag and drop Drag and drop is configurable for tables. This lets the user exchange column positions, excluding the first column. Tables that allow drag and drop provide the action in the column's header. Columns visibility You can only toggle visibility for columns that work with a management toolbar that implements this feature. All columns can be hidden, except the first one since it is the reference column. Columns layout A table can contain one or more columns, and deciding how to place them properly can be cumbersome. We provide a set of guidelines that you can follow to make this decision easier. While the main column must always be placed on the leftmost side, the remaining columns can be placed in a couple different layouts: 2 columns: Place the second column right next to the first column, while respecting the margins. N # of columns: Place columns equidistant. Content format and alignment Headers must always be left-aligned and semibold. The first column's value must always be semibold. The remaining columns values must be regular font weight. Text values, dates, stickers, labels, and badges must always be left-aligned. Numbers, with or without unit, must be right-aligned.

It is a combination of different components, including filters, orders, search, visualization select, and other actions that let users manage a dataset.","layout":"guide","weight":2,"content":" {$page.description} Note: The management toolbar doesn't have gray borders. They are just used in the examples on this page to show its height. Usage The Management Toolbar is always part of a bigger structure that works along with other data management patterns such as tables, lists, or card. Its functionality is directly related to them. The Management Toolbar has two main states: State 1 It is the default state. It displays tools focused on filtering, sorting, and data visualization. Checkbox: selects all elements on the current page Filter and Order: dropdown with dropdown menu associated. See dropdown with groups for more information. Sort toggle button: The arrow identifies the sorting order, depending on the selected option inside the Filter and Order dropdown. The main attribute, usually the name, states the default sort parameter. Search bar to filter out the current dataset Visualization button to select the desired visualization Plus button to add content and folders into the dataset State 2 It displays contextual tools when one or more items are selected. Only the specific actions that the selected dataset allows are displayed. The background color changes to reflect the change of state. Checkbox: To select all elements in the current page Counter: Selected elements counter Select all: To select all elements in the dataset Quick actions: set of quick actions with a visual representation Actions menu: on interaction, displays a dropdown menu with all the actions that can be applied over the selected dataset. Requirements The Management Toolbar has to be fixed to the page header so it can always be visible during the vertical scroll. In the default state of the toolbar, filter and order tools always have to be on the left side, and visualization and information tools have to be on the right side. In the second state, the tools for selected items always appear on the right side of the toolbar and vary according to the items selected. The Management Toolbar only displays the tools that the type of data displayed requires for a specific context. A user can only sort and filter by the elements that are visible in the current visualization. Examples Selection The Management Toolbar follows these rules for selection: State 1: A click on the checkbox, off state, selects all the elements on the current page. State 1 and 2: The checkbox is marked with a dash when only some of the items are selected in the whole dataset. State 2: Even if only some of the items are selected, clicking the checkbox selects all elements on the page. State 2: There is a \"Select all\" that selects all elements in the dataset. State 2: Unselecting the checkbox deselects all selected items in the dataset. Filter and order A dropdown button triggers the dropdown menu with groups. This configuration keeps the Management Toolbar organized by collapsing options into collapsible menus. Filter by: used to filter elements from the dataset. Order by: used to order the dataset by one of the available attributes. If there is no possible order or only one order available, this section must not appear. Group by: used to group the dataset in different ways. A title and a data provider with the different classification terms per each criteria must be provided. If there is no criteria to group by or there is only one criteria, this section must not appear. Filters are reflected in the results bar. This bar includes a label for each filter that is applied. Changing Views The icon button lets the user change visualization between tables, lists, and cards. This button must not appear if there is only one possible visualization. Search When a management Toolbar contains a search field, and it is used to filter elements, a thing stripe is displayed, informing the user of the total results. This can be combined with filters. Layout Variations The functionalities that are not required disappear. The Search field expands to fill the remaining space, as shown below. This example displays all the features: There may be cases where selection or filters are not required. In these cases, you can remove the elements from the Management Toolbar that you don't need. In this example, we only need the search field, a button to change visualizations, and the plus button to add elements into the dataset. You may not require the visualizations and the plus buttons. In this case, you can remove these options, as shown in the layout below: Having the management toolbar only configured with the search field is the minimum possible configuration. Last but not least, a very common case, and aforementioned in the View Case section, is to go without the visualizations button: Mobile State 1 On mobile devices, all actions are transformed into icons to conserve space and condense the toolbar to only one line. This provides more space for content, rather than tools. State 2 In contrast to the desktop version, no actions are available outside of the actions menu. Search The magnifying glass icon triggers the Management Toolbar to switch to the search state. The search field expands to the width of the whole bar to provide the best user experience. Search results Tap the entry in the search field to view the results. The Management Toolbar returns to state 1 with a summary of the results found. Mobile Layout Variations The search field grows to fill the remaining space leftover from features that were removed from the Management Toolbar. The example below displays all the features: This example only includes the options to change the view mode and add new elements: This example includes the options for selection, filter, and order: The dataset display in this case, only allows users to Search. The most common configuration includes all options, except the ability to change the view. Note: The management toolbar doesn't have gray borders.

These blocks or containers can be one of two different types: Field: used to make tight groups for items such as action icons Content: Fills the remaining space unused by fields as much as possible. If the toolbar contains multiple content blocks, the available space is equally divided for each content block. Layout Below are some example layouts that combine fields and contents: Example 1: Three consecutive fields Example 2: Three consecutive contents Example 3: Field - Content - Field The examples below show how these layouts are used for a management toolbar: Attributes The horizontal distance between elements is always 16px. This changes to 8px on mobile devices. The minimum vertical distance between elements is 16px. The search field is an exception to this rule.

This is usually used in configuration forms. Buttons. Visit Actions to learn how buttons are used in forms. Layout Forms can occupy one or two columns. If your form is divided into several sections that are stacked, it's best to keep the internal layout between sections. This can affect the experience of filling the whole form. When adding columns, remember that the reading direction for each column is left to right and top to bottom. The user reads column one first, then they read column two. One single form Two columns form Attributes Spacing It's very important to maintain the distance between form elements, such as texts, fields, sections, etc. Please see our hierarchy page for guidance. As a general rule of thumb, use the following distances for spacing between form elements: | Description | Desktop | Mobile | | --- | --- | --- | | Form padding | 24px | 16px | | Horizontal | | | | - Between consecutive components | 16px | 16px | | - Between non-consecutive components | 24px | 24px | | Vertical | | | | - Between consecutive components: title, fields, section... | 24px | 16px | | - Between form title or title + description for next component | 48px | 32px | Title Sections First level sections can be collapsible. Note that second level sections, however, can never be collapsible. The layout must wrap long section titles.

It's best to divide a form by context. When using a left navigation menu, the title's name must match the menu item's name. Wizards Forms can be used together with wizards (also called Multi step forms). Wizards let you simplify the complexity of a large form by reorganizing it into a process of smaller consecutive forms that you want the user to go through. There are 2 types of wizards: A Multi Step Form (also called a Wizard form) is used to divide the main tasks of a large form into smaller forms that contain subtasks and report the user's progression through the form. See Multi Steps Forms for more information. A simplified Multi Step form simply displays the user's progression through a form in a much less intrusive manner.

Try to place first as many mandatory fields when possible to make the user task short. Non mandatory fields should go in a second place as they are not so important and the user could like to skip them. In case non mandatory fields are in between mandatory fields the user would expend more time scanning the form. Fieldsâ length Fields must occupy the space you expect your user needs to fill it. The only requirement for fields is to adapt their width to the grid so they behave properly on window resize. Sharp shape forms do not go against Lexicon but we prefer rectangular shape form as they look more clear. In mobile view ports field lengths should be half of the screen or full length. Mandatory fields Fields can be mandatory/required to fill in a form. The way to mark a field as mandatory is: Try to place first as many mandatory fields when possible to make the user task short. Non mandatory fields should go in a second place as they are not so important and the user may like to skip them. In case non mandatory fields are in between mandatory fields the user would expend more time scanning the form. Repeatable fields Single repeatable field A single repeatable field is useful when the user must provide several pieces of information that require the same input type, and the number of fields and field order are not important. Set of repeatable fields This lets the user add blocks of the same type of content to a form. Sets of repeatable fields are usually combined with other form pieces. Additional sets can be added and existing sets can be removed. Actions General form actions General form actions are always placed at the end of the form on the left side in the same order: Primary, Secondary, and Link. Form actions should always use the default button size. Note: This order is reversed in modals in which buttons in the footer are right-aligned: Link, Secondary, Primary. Interior form actions Interior form actions are not as widely used as general actions. Therefore, use the secondary button for interior form actions. Dos and Don'ts Never use two primary buttons together. There must only be one primary button that represents the most important action. Do Don't Always use concrete words, rather than general words such as \"Ok\". Do Don't Boolean situations Boolean situations are those yes/no situations usually solved with checkboxes. Try to always be as explicit as possible to let the user know what is the outcome of the decision. Do not hide helpful information to the user in popovers, alerts, or secondary text.

It doesn't require the user to fill in the entire form or the form to be submitted to see it. Inline validation Forms have inline validation. All form fields that can be checked against a set of rules while filling them in must show success or error state to the user. At least one field required There may be a case when only one indeterminate field is required in a form or fieldset. In this case, follow these guidelines: Set a mandatory mark in the fieldset title. It is recommended to include a short help text below the title. Ex: \"Please enter at least one of the following fields.\" All fields must be marked with the corresponding validation color. Only one validation message is shown for one of the input fields in the group, preferably the first. A good help message specifies the error to the user and explains how to solve it. Once the validation conditions are met, the alert message disappears. Losing focus triggers validation, unless a field in the group is already focused. Full validation Forms are validated when they are submitted via the \"Save\" action. When a form is completely validated, it first runs partial validation on all of the mandatory fields. If this is successful, a service is called. The example below communicates the return of that service call with an embedded alert.

Each step can have three different states: Disabled, selected, or done. Use it to divide long and/or complicated tasks into smaller chunks that are easier for the user to complete. Use it to guide a user through a new or unfamiliar process. Use it when there is a specific sequence required to complete the form. Make chunks that are not overwhelming. Step names must be clear, short, and express the content below them. Use two words maximum. A multi step form must have a minimum of two steps: We recommend a maximum of seven steps for two key reasons: Seven is an easy number of elements to remember Seven is a good threshold for touch interaction on mobile devices If you add more than seven steps, the remaining steps should be grouped in a dropdown menu under the sixth element in the multi step form: A Multi step form is most commonly used to guide the user in the process of filling in a complex or long form.

Do Don't Radio A radio is a component that lets the user select the value that is written in its corresponding text label. Unlike checkboxes, a user can only select one radio button from a group at a time.

States | State | Definition | | ----- | ---------- | | | On | | | Off | | | On disabled | | | Off disabled | Radio Group Radios are commonly grouped in forms to provide a set of options. It's common to have to split a long list of options into several columns to reduce space. Deciding when to use one column or several columns can be difficult. The benefits of each approach are shown below: One column: It is always easier and faster to read, as the eye doesnât have to jump. Use it when you have long descriptions. Splitting into several columns: It reduces space. Make sure to have multiple options and to have at least six elements per column, otherwise there is no real benefit. Radio vs Dropdown Menu It can be difficult to decide whether to use a radio or a dropdown menu when users need to choose one option from a list of options. Although there is no strict rule to follow in these cases, we have provided some general guidelines below that you can consider when making this decision. Radios: When the number of options is small When options require lengthy descriptions Radio buttons are always listed vertically. Dropdown menus: When the number of options is large, or has the potential to become large Options should be of the same nature (e.g. a list of branches, or a list of people). Dos and Don'ts Capitalize a radio button's label. Do Don't Use radios when only one option can be selected. Do Don't Toggle A toggle is an interface element that, by its activation or deactivation, provokes an immediate action on the screen.

Do Don't Use toogles for activation. Do Don't Use checkboxes instead of toggles in confirmation messages. Do Don't Variations Toggle with data attributes This type of toggle has labels, title label or other support label, that reflect its value. The label can be positioned at the top, right, bottom, or left, and its value should always reflect the toggle's state. Keeping labels in sync with the toggle's value improves the accessibility for your users. Toggle with icon Toggle can also have an icon inside the toggle circle to help identify the action.

Multiple File Upload Inside this categorization we have two different patterns: file uploader and image uploader. Both are pretty similar, but the second one is more visual and adapted to the situation. Both uploaders share the same upload area which has the following attributes: It must always have two different states: Default Message: clarifies the permitted file extensions and max size of each file Secondary button: users may not always want to use the drag and drop feature. The button opens the operating system's file uploader with the option to select multiple files. Active It contains an animation that invites users to drop documents on dropover state. Once files have been added to the upload system, there must be clear options to upload more files: An explicit button and a drag and drop option. The scroll must only be vertical if needed. Each file can be deleted individually. Each file can retry the upload individually. File Uploader File uploader accepts any file, including images, pdfs, docs, etc. After dropping files in the area, the upload status of each file is displayed in a list. Files that didn't complete the upload process provide the option to retry the upload. Every file must be removable. In this example, the file uploader works together with a form to predefine configuration options for the uploaded files: Files can be in different states: Default state: when the file is already uploaded Upload state: during the upload process Error state: when the file upload has failed Image Uploader Image uploader only admits image file types. After dropping images in the area, an image grid appears, letting the user see the upload process. The drag and drop area fills the image grid. This area must have a vertical scroll. The cell next to the last uploaded image must have a \"+\" to invite the user to upload more files. Clicking in that cell opens the file upload for the specified files. Each image is represented by a square thumbnail. Images that didn't complete the upload process provide the option to retry the upload. Every image must be removable. Images can be in different states: Upload state: during the upload process. The default state is shown in the image on the left. The hover state is shown in the image on the right. Error state: when the file upload has failed Default and hover image states: when the file is already uploaded The image uploader may require a checked state for certain options: ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/satellites/fileUpload.md","id":"fileUpload","location":"/docs/satellites/fileUpload.html","url":"/docs/satellites/fileUpload.html"},"imageSelector":{"title":"Image Selector","titleLabel":"Portal","description":"The image selector lets the user select images from a grid, prioritizing over other metadata.","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" {$page.description} Usage Only use this pattern for image selection.
