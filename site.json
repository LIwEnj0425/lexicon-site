Accessibility is designing your product or site so that everyone can access it equally, regardless of visual impairment or other physical impairment or disability. Why should you provide accessible interfaces? Your product or site should be designed with everyone in mind. Accessibility is one of the main concerns of Liferay, therefore, Lexicon's system is designed with this in mind. Accessibility brings independence to people with disabilities. It offers the same range of possibilities to users with different physical problems. Remember that all your users are equally important. Accessibility may also be a legal requirement for your business. Some countries have strict regulations on accessibility, and they may enforce standards, which vary depending on the country, that you must follow.

Base Grid The Base Grid is the main metric reference of our system from which the rest of the layout structures are built. It defines the starting point of the dimensions, as well as the paddings and margins of the elements of the interface. The grid is constructed from a base 8px module, so that both the dimensions of the elements and the distances between them will always be multiples of 8: 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 … This provides a common metric pattern that creates a visual coherence and consistency between the different elements of the system and their spatial relationships. This grid favors an efficient workflow, reducing the number of design decisions, as well as creating a shared visual language between designers and developers. Specifying a metric unit of 8px helps maintain visual consistency and lets you take advantage of its other benefits. There may be situations, however, where a value ​​smaller than 8px is required. The 4px unit is available for these cases. Values ​​less than 8 px are primarily associated with the anatomy of the interface's basic elements, rather than specifying the distance between elements and page composition. Using Atomic Design's terminology, these minimum measurements should be used almost exclusively to define the internal anatomy of elements like atoms or molecules. They should always make sure that the block that forms the element fits the base grid of 8 px. For example, see the molecule formed below (the 4px margin) by a label and a text input, or the one formed by a label, a text input, and helper text. To learn more about the 8 px grid, see the articles listed below that have served as reference and inspiration for us to adopt this pattern: 8pt Grid Intro to The 8-Point Grid System Column System The column system is the main structural pattern for organizing and arranging elements on the page horizontally. It is not used to establish the distance between small elements, such as the icons or buttons in a toolbar, but rather it is a layout framework used to organize and establish divisions between medium and large blocks of content. Lexicon's column system is based on Bootstrap's twelve column CSS Grid, with an adjustment to the gutter to fit our base grid. The gutter of Lexicon's column system is 24px, the same value that is used throughout other basic structural references of the system. The columns are fluid, having a responsive width that conforms to the size of their parent container. The gutter's width, however, remains fixed when the viewport resizes. Vertical Rhythm The 8px base grid is also used as a baseline to determine the vertical distance between elements. When determining the vertical distance between medium and large size structural blocks of elements, such as lengthy paragraphs, however, it is better to have a greater value as a baseline. This value borrows Bootstrap's variable name: \"spacer-y\". To keep a consistent vertical rhythm, we use the main system font style's line height, 24 px, as the reference for this value. For small viewports, we can make adjustments to optimize vertical space, while still respecting the base grid. In these cases, we use the 16px spacer-y, as we do for the gutter between columns and the lateral space of the container. Although this metric may not cover all vertical space requirements, it serves as a starting point that you can adjust to meet your needs. Containers Lexicon provides two types of containers: A fixed width container and a fluid container with relative width. Fluid container This container's width is responsive to the size of the viewport. Fixed width container This container defines a maximum width. This value adjusts to the viewport's size based on predefined breakpoints. Breakpoint table The table below shows the layout system values for the different breakpoints: | Breakpoint | Device Size | Container Width | | ---------- | ----------- | ------------------- | | < 576px | Extra small devices (Portrait phones) | Auto | | &ge; 576px | Small devices (Landscape phones) | Auto | | &ge; 768px | Medium devices (Tablets) | Auto | | &ge; 992px | Large devices (Desktops) | Auto | | &ge; 1280px | Extra large devices (Large desktops) | 1248px | ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/designPrinciples/grid.md","id":"grid","location":"/docs/designPrinciples/grid.html","url":"/docs/designPrinciples/grid.html"},"typography":{"title":"Typography","titleLabel":"Clay","titleLabelLink":"https://clayui.com/docs/layout/typography.html","description":"A basic reference for the definition of the visual identity and the organization of the content.","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" {$page.description} Font Stacks Lexicon uses two text styles exclusively: A sans serif one, which is the main style, and a monospaced one used to render code. Lexicon takes an agnostic approach to typography, due to the customizable, multi-language, and multi-platform nature of Liferay's products. Therefore, Lexicon doesn't include any specific font family as part of its framework. Instead, it relies on the native font family of the user's operating system. This way we avoid web-font delivery services or font files stored on the server. Lexicon and Clay embrace the standard known as \"Native Font Stack\" as the basis for its typographic source. The tables in the sections below list the font families available for each operating system's native font stack. Sans Serif For sans serif style, using Bootstrap's native font stack as inspiration, we also include families for Ubuntu, Oxygen, and Gnome operating systems: | OS | Font Family | | -- | ----------- | | Windows | Segoe UI | | MacOS & iOS | San Francisco | | Chrome OS & Android | Roboto | | Ubuntu | Ubuntu | | OxygenOS | Oxygen | | Cantarell | Gnome | | Basic web fallbacks | Arial, Helvetica Neue, sans-serif | | Emoji Fonts | Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol | system-ui,-apple-system,BlinkMacSystemFont,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Oxygen-Sans,Ubuntu,Cantarell,\"Helvetica Neue\",Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Symbol\"; Monospaced For monospaced style, we also follow the same approach as Bootstrap: | OS | Font Family | | -- | ----------- | | Windows | Segoe UI | | MacOS & iOS | San Francisco | | Chrome OS & Android | Roboto | | Basic web fallback | Courier New, monospaced | SFMono-Regular,Menlo,Monaco,Consolas,\"Liberation Mono\",\"Courier New\",monospace; Since Mac OS is the most widely used operating system for design tasks in Liferay and in general, we have decided to use the San Francisco font family for the visual examples in both the technical documentation and in the Lexicon Site. Type Scale As we approached the foundational elements with simplification and standardization in mind, so too have we approached type scale. Lexicon's type scale is based on Bootstrap and follows one of the most widely used type scales in web products today. Lexicon's type scale is based on an initial increase of 2px that grows to 4px in larger font sizes to favor contrast and improve readability. It follows a non-linear arithmetic progression that's understandable and easy to use in both simple and complex applications. px rem example 10px 0.625rem Design matters 12px 0.75rem Design matters 14px 0.875rem Design matters 16px 1rem Design matters 18px 1.125rem Design matters 20px 1.25rem Design matters 24px 1.5rem Design matters 28px 1.75rem Design matters 32px 2rem Design matters 36px 2.25rem Design matters 40px 2.rem Design matters Basic Formatting Line Height Lexicon uses two reference line heights for its typography: A standard line height with a 1:1.5 ratio and another one used for headings with a 1:1.25 ratio. 1:1.5 is one of the most common line height ratios used in web development right now. A body font of 16px (1rem) returns a value of 24px (1.5rem), which is the main reference measurement for the vertical organization of content in Lexicon. Using a minimum value of 1.5 for the line-height for main paragraph content also improves accessibility for people with low vision or cognitive concerns such as Dyslexia. We perceive the space between large font sizes a bit differently. The white space between lines appears more prominent. Therefore, it is considered best practice to reduce the line height in font sizes that are 20 pixels or larger. The same is true for uppercase texts. Therefore uppercase headings in Lexicon, despite only being 12px and 14px, also use a ratio of 1:1.25. | Line Height | ratio | | -- | ----------- | | Standard | 1:1.5 | | Secondary | 1:1.25 | Lexicon's Line height only applies to texts elements that run more than one line, such as paragraphs, headlines, and list group items. For the remainder of the UI elements that contain text, such as buttons, single line input fields, stickers, badges, or labels, this value is defined by the implementation. Font Weight For efficiency and simplicity, Lexicon only incorporates three font weights for content: Font Weight Reference Regular 400 Semibold 600 Bold 700 The use cases for each font weight are covered in the \"Type Styles\" section. Letter Case Lexicon uses lowercase as a basis, regardless of the specific capitalization rules. Uppercase is only used as a hierarchy resource in the section divider pattern used in dataset display views and forms. The use cases for each letter case are covered in the \"Type Styles\" section. Line Length To provide optimal reading conditions, we recommend that you use a line width within a range between 60 and 100 characters, including spacing, for medium and long text blocks. This gives a good flow to the reading and reduces the potential for straining the reader's eyes. Type styles The tables in this section show the format combinations that are available in Lexicon, along with reference examples. Headings | Font Size | Line Height | Font Weight | Letter Case | Use Example | | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | | 12px / 0.75rem | 1.25 | 600 (semibold) | Uppercase | Dataset section divider | | 14px / 0.875rem | 1.25 | 600 (semibold) | Uppercase | Form section divider | | 16px / 1rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Application and Page titles | | 20px / 1.25rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Form title | | 24px / 1.5rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Asset title in asset display widgets | | 28px / 1.75rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Blog Entry title in blogs widget | | 36px / 2.25rem | 1.25 | 700 (bold) | Lowercase | Blog Entry Detail title | Paragraph | Font Size | Line Height | Font Weight | Letter Case | Use Example | | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | | 16px / 1rem | 1.5 | 400 (regular) | Lowercase | Mid-long read text | The paragraph element incorporates a bottom margin of 0.75rem (12px) to define the separation between text blocks.

Without the proper messaging for your product’s navigation and functionality, uncertainty creeps into your users minds. The messages and naming conventions you use throughout your product complement its design. No matter how well-constructed your design, poor messaging can doom your product’s effectiveness. Clarity, confidence, and consistency in messaging promotes product reliability. Be Clear Longer messaging is not always more helpful. Be concise; understand your user’s needs in a given situation, and provide them with just enough information to be successful. If an interaction is obvious, don’t add messaging. A wordy product is an eyesore. Example Initiates the process If you click this button, then you will initiate a process that does something. Doing something is essential for something else. Be Confident Be bold! Take confidence in what you say! The way you provide information sets the tone for what users expect. Products that exude confidence put users at ease when making difficult decisions. Example Click this to save your work. Clicking this should save your work. Be Current Use present tense throughout product messaging. Promote the product as being alive; it helps you now, telling you what to do now. If you click a button, it won’t do something later; it accomplishes the task immediately. Example Saves the form This will save the form. Be Consistent Consistency gives users peace of mind. You want people to feel comfortable navigating your product. Surprises and uncertainty make people uncomfortable. Consistent messaging gives users freedom to focus on what they’re doing, instead of worrying about what the product is trying to tell them. Below are two example techniques you can apply for consistent phrasing: 1. Apply Text Styles Consistently Formulate the styling you want to use in your product and stick to it. For example, you could assign styling standards to messaging types in your product (e.g., headings, instructions, checkboxes, etc.). Title: Capitalize all words (except articles, prepositions, and coordinating conjunctions) and omit any trailing punctuation. Phrase: Capitalize only the first word and all proper nouns, and omit any trailing periods (question marks allowed). Sentence: Capitalize only the first word and all proper nouns, and use normal punctuation. Tone, capitalization, and punctuation should follow a similar style on any given interface. Example 2. Address Your Users the Same Way For example, don’t refer to them as we, the user, and you in the same context. Example Click the button to continue. You can select the other button at any time. Click the button so we can continue. The user can select the other button at any time. Remember, your writing style sets the tone for your product. Show people you care by guiding them with sensible, consistent messaging.

Responsive behavior On viewport sizes equal to or less than 768px, we introduce two key changes to the layout that optimize space for content: The the vertical navigation changes to a toggle top navigation, as is described in Nested navigation. The box changes from 9 to 12 columns. Attributes Example 3+8 columns (Forms) This configuration is used for forms. Form containers require less space than the 9 columns that the default layout provides, so the columns are reduced to 8. Responsive behavior Note that, to optimize space for content, the layout changes from 8 to 9 columns on viewport sizes equal to or less than 992px. Attributes Example Exceptions The 3+9 column and 3+8 column layouts cover most Lexicon interfaces. There may, however, be a few edge cases that these layouts don't cover: Scenario 1: A 3+9 columns configuration turns into 2+10 columns configuration. Scenario 2: A 3+8 columns configuration turns into 2+9 columns configuration. These scenarios are only desirable when two columns is enough for the sidebar's width. You may want to consider these configurations, If the points shown below are true for your UI: You have really short vertical navigation titles across all languages that your site manages. You have more space in the main box to fit a table with many columns. If you use these configurations, make sure you apply two columns for the sidebar in all application sections for consistency.","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/designPrinciples/layout/layoutSidebar.md","id":"layoutSidebar","location":"/docs/designPrinciples/layout/layoutSidebar.html","url":"/docs/designPrinciples/layout/layoutSidebar.html"}},"childIds":["layoutFull","layoutCards","layoutForm","layoutSidebar"]}},"title":"Foundations","description":"Keep updated.","layout":"guide","icon":"lexicon-site-principles","weight":2,"content":"","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/designPrinciples/index.md","id":"designPrinciples","location":"/docs/designPrinciples/","url":"/docs/designPrinciples/","childIds":["accessibility","animations","colors","grid","layout","typography","writingstyle"]},"lexicon":{"title":"Get Started","description":"User experience design language.","layout":"guide","icon":"lexicon-site-about","weight":1,"content":" Design language Lexicon is a design language that provides a common framework for building interfaces within the Liferay product ecosystem. It is a guide to foundations, components, patterns, and use cases that provide consistency and coherence to these products, and, ultimately, provides a satisfactory and unified experience to its users. Lexicon is a living project, evolving and adapting over time to new and rising technologies to meet the needs of the people. Modular approach Lexicon takes a modular approach to interface design. It is a cohesive system that's able to respond to the various needs of Liferay's products through a base set of components. It seeks to simplify processes, reduce production times, and above all, to provide a consistent user experience across the board. To achieve this goal, Lexicon uses Brad Frost's Atomic Design approach to interface design: A work methodology, based on modularity, that seeks to give a more hierarchical and organized structure to the creation of interface design systems. It's a nonlinear process, organized across five stages: Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates, and Pages. Lexicon site This site explains the design specs and proper usage of Lexicon's system of components for designers, developers, and overall digital creators. While it is primarily for the Liferay community, it is open to anyone who wants to use its components or make contributions or suggestions to improving it. Foundations These are the principles that the design system is built on. Modifications to these principles affect the component's behavior. These include foundational elements such as colors, grid, and typography. Core Components This section contains the common components that are essential to build interfaces. Each component defines its rules and behaviors. Each component's look and feel is based on the combination of the foundations mentioned above. Therefore, changes to the foundation principles propagate to the entire system. In our case, these components are implemented by Clay. Satellite Components These components are for the needs of specific products or applications. They are built using Lexicon's foundations and core components. They belong to the product or application that created them, rather than the design system itself. Templates Templates offer prebuilt solutions to tackle repetitive interface challenges. They speed up the design process, as they only require minor modifications to fit your use case and display your content. Examples This section showcases practical designs by UX Designers that demonstrate how core components and satellite components are applied to create Lexicon interfaces that tackle specific scenarios. The components in this site include the labels shown below, which indicate if the component links to its implementation or the product where you can find them. This lets you view the components in a real-world application and context. | Label | Usage | | ---- | ----- | | VIEW IN CLAY | Links to the pattern implementation | | PRODUCT NAME | The pattern is used in a concrete product or application | | PENDING | The pattern has been designed and will be implemented either in Clay or a Product/Application. | Implement Lexicon Lexicon is not an implementation. It is a set of patterns, rules, and behaviors that any library can implement.

Resources: DEVCON 2018 presentation link and links to blog posts made by Lexicon Team. October 13th, 2018 General update Examples: As promised, we are updating the examples section. This time we bring you an example from Liferay Partner Portal submitted by Patrick Pentz. Dropdown menu: Dropdown menu definition has been updated to accept icons on the left side of actions. Tabs: Tabs have been updated with an example to give context in tab bars. October 12th, 2018 Management bar update We are happy to announce that we have a new update for the Management Toolbar. The Toolbar is now able to contextualize actions based on the selection in the dataset. This reduces the number of potential errors by narrowing the actions down to only the ones that are relevant to the selected elements. Moreover, we introduce the results bar when filters are applied and/or search is performed from the Management Toolbar. This provides the user with useful and visible feedback. October 4th, 2018 Examples Lexicon can be used to create many different interfaces. Today, we open a new \"Examples\" section in our site to showcase different Lexicon interface examples created by Liferay UX designers for our products. We hope these series of examples inspire you and give you an idea of the possible interfaces you can create. These examples will grow over time to showcase a wide variety of interfaces built with Lexicon. August 21st, 2018 New organization Components are now organized into two key groups: Core and Satellite. Core components are the basic components that are widely used by Liferay products. Satellite components are the remaining components that are not used that often in many Liferay products. Although these components are not as widely used, they can save you time from reinventing the wheel. Note: that core components are implemented and supported by Clay, while satellite components are not supported. We have also created a Templates section that includes the most common templates created with Lexicon components in Liferay products. August 21st, 2018 Predictive Forecast Chart Predicitive Forecast Chart has been documented inside the charts section. This chart is very useful for commerce data. June 27th, 2018 Stable version We also want to highlight the improvements made since the last release: The site has now uses the system font like we do in Lexicon. All images have been changed from Source Sans Pro to San Francisco (system font for MacOS) A large number of patterns now include attribute sections that describe the pattern's anatomy. Examples have been added to many of our patterns, and the descriptions have been updated. Moreover, now you can find our sketch library under resources section to build your own interfaces using Lexicon. April 24th, 2018 Beta release We are glad to announce that we are in beta right now. We will update style changes before leaving beta status. April 20th, 2018 General Update This update comes with many small updates that improve communication: Charts: base layer interaction and different chart examples Forms: reorganized for better understanding Animations: pending, but an introduction is there as reference Labels: patterns have been labeled to specify if they are implemented by Clay or if they are owned by another team/application. Status table: specifies the design and implementation status for each component's page January 17th, 2018 General Update This update comes with many small updates that improve communication: Dos and Don'ts have been included for the following patterns: badges, labels, table, actions definition, and popover. This helps clarify the proper usage of each pattern. Multiple step form now includes an example that demonstrates how to use the pattern. Text input localizable has been released. Card layout has been added to the Layout section under the Foundation heading. Vertical navigation now includes an example of a collapsible menu on mobile. Sidebar documentation has been organized into several areas of focus. January 8th, 2018 Examples Examples, along with images demonstrating the proper usage, have been added to the table page to clarify the row hover action. Multistep form has also been updated with a layout example in a form to better illustrate how to use it. Finally, checkbox group and radio group examples, along with metrics, have been added. January 3rd, 2018 Sites A full set of components is available in the sites section for you to use to build your own site widgets. This lets you transform old widgets, by bringing them new life with a better information architecture, structure, and a refreshing design. November 28th, 2017 Layouts and Form Hierarchy As part of the improvement in Lexicon, we want to clearly define the different layout possibilities that you'll usually find in admin pages. Layout is one of the foundation principles that is key to building interfaces with our system. We've add a dedicated page for form hierarchy to better define the form pattern. The Forms section now also includes a Slider section. November 20th, 2017 Charts and Sites Charts and Sites have been documented at their initial stage. Charts are a completely new pattern in Lexicon. We want to provide a full set of principles for it to improve accessibility, perception, and interpretation. Sites tackles widgets for sites. Lexicon faces a huge improvement in this area towards improving not only the visual aspect, but also the usability in some of our ADTs. Many improvements will come in the near future in this area as the next portal release date grows closer. November 13th, 2017 Updates Liferay is happy to announce a new alpha version of Lexicon. The alpha version brings a wider range of possibilities, new components, and a brand new color palette. Lexicon now focuses on accessibility, shorter interactions, and ways to achieve a better user experience never before seen in Liferay. This alpha version will transition to beta as soon as Lexicon and Clay align.","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/news/News.md","id":"News","location":"/docs/news/News.html","url":"/docs/news/News.html"},"status":{"title":"Status","description":"Lexicon upcoming site status","layout":"guide","weight":1,"content":" Last Update June 26th, 2018 | Legend | | ---- | | &#9679; Done | | &#9679; In Progress | | &#9679; Pending | | Page | Lexicon | Clay CSS | Clay Component | | ---- | ----- | ----- |----- | | FOUNDATIONS | | Animations | &#9679; | NA | &#9679; | | Color | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Grid | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Layout | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Typography | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Writing style | &#9679; | NA | NA | | ALERT | | Alert Toast | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Alert Embedded | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | BADGE | | Badge | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | BUTTON | | Button | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Button icon | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Button icon and text | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Button dropdown | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Button group | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | CARD | | Card image | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Card user | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Card file | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Card folder | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | CHART | | Bar chart | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Donut chart | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Heatmap chart | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Line chart | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Pie chart | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Stacked bar chart | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Scatterplot chart | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | CONFIRMATION MESSAGE | | Confirmation Message | &#9679; | NA | NA | | DROPDOWN MENU | | Dropdown menu | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | FILE UPLOAD | | File upload | &#9679; | NA | NA | | FORM | | Checkbox, Radio, Toggle | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Actions definition | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Multi Step Form | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Multi Step Form Simplified | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Selectors | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Slider | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input Group | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input Localizable | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input Variation Autocomplete text field | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input Variation Search field | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input Variation Labels input field | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input Variation Date field | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input Variation Numeric field | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Text Input Variation Password field | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | ICONS | | Icons | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | IMAGE SELECTOR | | Image selector | &#9679; | NA | NA | | LABEL | | Labels | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | LINK | | Link | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | LIST | | List | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | LOADING INDICATOR | | Loading indicator | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | MODALS | | Modals | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | NAVIGATION | | Breadcrumb | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Header | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Navbar | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Vertical Nav | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | PAGINATION | | Pagination | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Pagination bar | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | POPOVER & TOOLTIPS | | Popover | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Tooltips | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | PROGRESS BAR | | Progress bar | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | SIDEBAR | | Sidebar | &#9679; | NA | NA | | Info Panel | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Product Menu | &#9679; | NA | NA | | TABLE | | Table | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | Inline Edit Table | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | TABS | | Tabs | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | | TOOLBAR | | Toolbar | &#9679; | NA | NA | | Management toolbar | &#9679; | &#9679; | &#9679; | ","srcFilePath":"src/pages/docs/news/status.md","id":"status","location":"/docs/news/status.html","url":"/docs/news/status.html"}},"title":"News","description":"Keep updated.","layout":"guide","icon":"lexicon-site-news","weight":7,"content":" July 22nd, 2017 License update Updates Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

Multiple File Upload Inside this categorization we have two different patterns: file uploader and image uploader. Both are pretty similar but the second one is more visual and adapted to the situation. Both uploaders share the same upload area which works in the following way: It must always have 2 different states: Default Message: to clarify file extension permitted, max size of each file. Secondary button: as not always users would want to user the drag and drop feature. The button opens the operating system file uploader with the possibility of selecting multiple files. Active It contains an animation that invites users to drop documents on dropover state. Once files have been added to the upload system, there must be always clear options to upload more files, explicit button and drag and drop option. The scroll must be only vertical if needed. Each file can be deleted individually. Each file can retry the upload individually File Uploader File uploader admits any kind of file further that images as it can be pdfs, docs, etc. After dropping files in the area, a list with the upload status is displayed allowing the users to see the upload status of each single file. Files that didn't complete the upload process provide the option to retry the upload. Every file must be always possible to be removed. In this example the file uploader counts with a form to predefine a certain configuration for the files uploaded. Files can be in different states: Default state: when the file is already uploaded Upload state: while the is the upload process Error state: the file upload has failed Image Uploader Image uploader only admits image file types. After dropping images in the area, a images grid appears allowing the user see the upload process. The drag and drop area hots the image grid. This are must have a vertical scroll. The cell next to last uploaded image must have a \"+\" to invite the user to upload more files. Clicking in that cell opens the file upload for the specified files. Each images is represented by its squared thumbnail. Images that didn't complete the upload process provide the option to retry the upload. Every image must be always possible to be removed. Images can be in different states: Upload state: while the is the upload process. Left side default state, right side hover state.

Do Don't Don't Done Use it as the primary button copy in all modal that display a table / list / card view to select one or several elements. Do Don't Select vs Choose The convention in Lexicon is to use Select instead of Choose, as Select is a more formal word.

Alerts must always have the status icon and the keyword that defines the message type and in semibold. Alerts can have multiple text lines. All alerts types can contain links. Those links are defined in primary color. Alerts can be defined as temporary in the case of toast and stripe. In these cases the delay time is: 10 sec if there are actions associated. 5 sec if there are no actions associated. In both cases the time freezes on hover to allow more time to the user to interact with the alert message. On mouse out the countdown continues. Types | Type | Usage | | ----- | ----- | | Error | Red color. This alert indicates that something went wrong after performing an action. (E.g.: Form couldn’t be saved because some data was missing) | | Success | Green color. Success alert messages will appear when everything was ok.

Attributes An alert has 4 different attributes: The status icon. Type text. Descrition text. Close button. That might appear or not depending on the use you give to the alert in a context. Please see the following image to understand how an alert is built: Variations Toast This type of alert is specific for toast messages. This type of messages appear on the top right corner of the screen. The maximum width of a toast message is 360px and the height can vary depending on the number of rows. It always have a close action. This alert type must appear at the bottom left side of the screen. 24px separation from the left and from the bottom.

Do Don't Variations Secondary borderless Secondary borderless button is meant to be used in those cases as toolbars where the secondary button would be too heavy for the pattern design. In this way the design gets cleaner. Icon button Buttons can icons instead of text and for that icons need to be monospaced inside the button. Lexicon do not use buttons with text and icon, or text and loading indicator. Icon buttons are used intensively in management bars. This button variation can be primary, secondary or borderless type. Icon and text button This button type is used only in sites and not in administration. The icon emphasizes and helps to understand the action. The label must be the same icon purpose. Block level button All buttons can also be configured at block level. Use this configuration in those cases that you need the user to realize there is an important action to be done. It could be used as a load more action below a list, as an example. Please do not use it in forms. Be always careful with the type button to use, primary is not always the best choice neither the only configuration. Dropdown button Dropdown buttons are always used together with a dropdown menu. This button variation can be secondary or borderless type. Split button Split buttons are used in those cases where you need to offer the user a quick main action but also secondary actions. Button group Button groups are used to switch between complementary views for example, but they must never be used for complementary actions and \"Change and Cancel\" or \"Save and Cancel\". In those cases the use of single buttons is the correct solution. Plus button Normally placed in toolbars, allows to have adding actions over a dataset.

A good example of this could be your users database or an image library. Cards are not meant to compare information in an exhaustive way but a light way. In case you need exhaustive comparison and not based on image comparison, you must use a table. Cards in Lexicon are open to many configurations. We provide a flexible card layout for you to configure it as you want. Later on this page we provide a series of examples we use in our systems for you to get inspired. Card interaction A card can have a checkbox, a radio or none of them. Selecting a card is only possible by using the checkbox or radio, and the image area. Main text in the card can be configured to navigate In case of: Folder: it navigates to the next level. File / Image / User: it navigates to its detail view. Do never use it for preview. Preview is always a secondary action placed inside the action menu. If the link drives the user out of the site, please identify visually that this link will open in a new page. Layout By providing a flexible layout, Lexicon opens you a wider range of possible configurations for your card. Every element can be used or deleted adapting it to your specific needs in each use case. As you can see in the following image, a card is shaped by: Image area: main element in this pattern. 16:9. Checkbox or radio: useful when working together as a visualization type with a management bar. Sticker or User image: Useful to identify the file type or the owner. Information area Text lines of different importance: relevant information. Actions menu: actions associated to the card Among these elements, the only one that can't be removed for the pattern meaning is the image. Image card Used in image/document galleries. Default Hover Active Empty Image with different ratios It is important to highlight that images can have different sizes. To provide the end user with that relevant data about the image Lexicon incorporates cards that allow this feature. Attributes Checkbox Image Sticker: file type Title Actions button Detail or short descriptive text Label: status identifier User card User card is used to represent users. The user can be represented by its user image or up to two initials extracted from the uses name or name + surname. File card File card is used to represent files different to images. Folder card This card variation is meant to have horizontal representations of information. This card has the same amount of elements as the previous explained. The main purpose of this card is to represent folders, therefore we allow to remove the image in this card type. In this case, only the checkbox is used to select. Sections Card sections help to separate different contents by a certain categorization or typology. Examples of use Examples can be found in dataset template.

Such situation can be a complete change of context, or an action that could be not reversed such as a site deletion. There are two main use categories that helps you to identify the correct situations to use confirmation messages: Risk action: The action the user is going to perform has significant consequences that cannot be undone or easily undone. Ex: site deletion. Unintended consequence: There is an important side effect on the action the user is taking that most probably will make her feel lost. Ex: Site switch, where there is a complete change of context including user permissions. It is very important to use this pattern only when it is needed as it is a very intrusive pattern, so take a time to think if your case is included in the previous set. This message type should be rarely needed in the system. When must not use it Error prevention: put first the effort on your interface to guide the user on what is going to happen. Clear copy’s prevent the usage of confirmation messages. Feedback: providing extremely clear feedback can prevent the usage on confirmation messages. Undo actions: if action has an undo action you must never use a confirmation message. A clear example is “Move to Recycle Bin”. Don’t use it if it is not really needed. How to write a confirmation message Writing a good confirmation message is relevant to make it really effective in such exclusive situation: Do not write generic and open questions. Ex: Are you sure? Be clear and concise. Provide exact data to your user so there is no uncertainty on the action to be confirmed.

The most common visualization types used are table, list and card. Previous Next Usage This pattern is used when the elements of the visualization require collective management, therefore the management bar becomes important as it facilitates tools needed to work with the dataset. This pattern can be only used one time in a page. Use it is you want to have several visualizations for a set of data. Use it if you want to perform actions over the data at individual level or group level. Only use the needed visualizations. Not all visualizations are appropriate for all data types. When the result of a filter is an empty result, the filter must be possible to be changed to another filter not blocking the management bar usage. Always offer a descriptive message on empty datasets due to no elements or no match in the search. Use a list view If you need to display a homogeneous sets of basic data. If you need to sort, group, or filter simple data sets. If you don’t need to compare between attributes of different items. If you need to display a single-level hierarchy. If you need to provide a quick identification of the basic content of a list item at a glance. Use a table view If you need to manage complex data sets that need to be extensively sorted, grouped, filtered, or edited.. If you need to compare between attributes of different items. If you work with complex hierarchies. Use a grid view If the primary content consists on images. Use of other visualization methods Other visualization methods are also possible, such as map view, but you will have to implement it by yourself as it is not the most common case we have in our platform. Empty state It is important to let the user know what happens in empty states and let them know what has happened and how to perform actions to move out from that empty state. All these scenarios can be found in detail at empty states page. Individual actions Individual actions are all those actions that an element has. This actions are always possible to reach from the element itself through the actions menu. Some of this actions are also placed in the management bar when only one element from the dataset is selected. These actions are always represented by a metaphor, , they are buttons with icon. Only those actions that can be easily represented by an icon will be there. Not all possible represented by an icon must be there, only the ones considered as more relevant. Collective actions Collective actions are shown in the management bar when more than one element is selected in the dataset. In case there are collective actions that don't have an icon representation the can be placed in a dropdown triggered from the actions button. Filtering Use filter only when you need them. When a filter is applied from the management bar to a visualization type, the visualization type itself needs to update to show the specific data requested by the user. A user is only able to filter by the elements that are displayed. Hidden elements can not be used for filtering as they must not appear among the filtering options. When the result of a filter is an empty result, the filter must be possible to be changed to another filter not blocking the management bar usage. Sorting When sorting is applied from the management bar to a visualization type, the visualization type itself needs to update to show the specific data requested by the user. A user is only able to sort by the elements that are displayed. Hidden elements can be used for sorting as they must not appear among the sorting options. Tables are able to show the sorting applied in the column header. This update must be done in both ways: When the user sorts using the column header the value must be marked on the sort panel and the arrow must indicate the “sort direction”. When the user sorts using the sort panel and button, the action must be reflected in the appropriate column header. Selection When an item is selected in any of the views the management bar must change state 2. This state has a different background color so the user can notice the change. Depending on the number of items selected in the visualization, the number of actions adapt. One item selected: The available actions are the same as in the row. More than one item selected: The available actions are the ones that apply to the group. The check box in the management bar selects/unselects all elements in the visualization. Drag and drop example Change view Changing view is something to have only when there is more than one visualization. Otherwise, this pattern must not appear in the management bar.

DragStart: Click or Tap with Holding and Moving the pointer will start the drag of the element. Drag: The element is being dragged. DragLeave: The element leaves its original position or a valid target. DragEnter: The element enters a valid drop target. Drop: The element is released in a valid or not valid target. DragEnd: The result of the drop action. Successful if it matches the conditions for drop target. Actors Pointer An interface element to take care about in this interaction is the pointer when using pointing devices as a mouse. Please follow the guide: | Type | Usage | | --- | ---- | | | Default: the standard mouse cursor. | | | Open hand: you can use it with the hover state of an element when is possible to move it around and the selection is not allowed (possible examples: a map, a zoomed image). | | | Dragging: Always required as feedback for the dragging action when using a mouse. | Handler A dragable element can be difficult to identify in the interface. To improve the affordance of these elements we encourage you to user the drag-dots icon in the component on hover. A good example can be found in a list where the list items are draggable. Drag Element & Drag Feedback Elemnents that are draggable must offer a feedback also when these elements are being dragged. Resize item while dragging When dragging a single element, this must resize a 70% and accompany the cursor as presented in the following image. Multiple elements dragging Dragging multiple elements may require inform the user about how many elements are being dragged. For that we offer a badge to reflect this amount. The badge must always be placed at the top-right from the cursor. The multiple selection will be previewed together with the grabbed element and while moving it. Drag Source There are two variants to show feedback in the drag source. Setting its opacity to 40%. In some cases it could be necessary to simplify the drag source feedback, for those cases you can use a placeholder using the same size of the element. The background color gets #272833 with 4% opacity. This might require to be adapted depending on the use case. The drag source is the original position of the dragged element and it will be visible when the Drag Element is being dragged away from its Drag Source (event: DragLeave). The default style for the drag source will display a copy of the Drag Element setting the opacity at 40%. Valid Target A Valid Target is the possible drop area of an element, used as destination of the Drag Element. There could also be multiple Valid Targets in the same page and the user can decide where to drop the Drag Element. Default: No interaction The default the valid target will use a grey background and a grey dashed border. This can be used in scenarios where files need to be dragged. Please use text inside to improve the affordance. DragEnter: Dragging Interaction Dragging an element into a valid target area activates the target area. In this case you must respect the border line style but make it blue as show in the image. Drop and DropEnd: Dropping Result After dropping the Drag Element inside the Valid Target it will trigger the Drop and DropEnd event. Dropping result on cards sorting You can use the Drop/DragEnd event to magnetize the Drag Element to the Valid Target, this will improve the accuracy of the drag and drop action when the element changes position in the same page. Dropping result on move elements to folder Moving the Drag Element into another element to change its location (like a folder) will trigger an animation with a border that expands and hides. This helps as feedback for the dropped element. It is also recommended to show a success alert after the action is done, this will the user know that the elements were move correctly and give the possibility to undo the action using a link. Dropping result on list sort Another way to define a valid target is to use a blue line of 4px between the elements. We recommend to use fluid animations to generate a more natural feedback of moving around elements.

This mechanism helps to clean-up the screen making everything more implicit. Dropdowns are usually triggered from a dropdown button or a button with icon, as the actions button. These are the two most extended cases in Lexicon. Closing a dropdown can be done by: Selecting an option in the panel, if they are mutually exclusive. Clicking on the button that triggered it. Clicking outside the panel. A dropdown menu can contain any kind of basic form component / element like text field, list of options, list of options with radios, list of options with checkboxes, or button. Dropdowns have a maximum width of 240px. When an entry text doesn't fit into the available space, use 2 lines. The text in each entry should be short and specific enough to not use more than one line. Maximum height is established in 600px for desktop and 400px in mobile. Vertical scroll is allowed when the content exceeds the limit. The distance from the button to the dropdown is 8px. Types Default The default dropdown is just a panel not prepared for scrolling the content inside it. Use this type when the number of options you want to offer is short or the panel is big enough to contain all the elements you want to use. Dropdown with dividers Dropdown menu with dividers are thought to be used in actions menus. Dividing the actions by context of use help users to find actions. Dropdown with checkbox or radio Dropdowns can be configured to have checkboxes and/or radio groups. A checkbox configuration can be suitable to filter in or out dataset elements. While, a radio configuration can be suitable to establish the order criteria in a dataset. Dropdown with search field Sometimes action menus face problems with the number of elements they contain. This dropdown menu variation helps in those contexts where the set of options is large and a search mechanism helps to reduce the search time and task complexity. Dropdown with left icons Dropdown menus with left icons are suitable for situations like: Process bars (wizards) where there is a need to display a dropdown menu when the number of steps do not fit the screen. Actions menus to help identifying actions that are tight related to their icons. Dropdown with right icons Dropdown menus with left icons are suitable for process bars (wizards) where there is a need to display a dropdown menu when the number of steps do not fit the screen. In this case, the step number has a high relevance, therefore the icon is placed on the right side. Dropdown with groups This dropdown menu variation is created to be used with the management bar Filter and Order dropdown button. This configuration is thought to clean the management bar providing the user with more specific mechanisms to find data. The button in a dropdown menu can be either primary or secondary depending on the application needs. Sorting actions Dropdown menu from actions button Guideline: (not all steps are always in use) Order by context (use a separator line between each of the groups): Primary commands: edit, preview, open… Secondary commands specific of the object: expire, view history Transfer commands: copy, duplicate, move, export, import Object settings: permissions, configuration Object commands: delete, move to the recycle bin General rules Group size must be less or equal than 7. The total number of elements must not exceed 15 items. Use separator lines between groups. Do not increase the menu complexity with submenus. Order inside a group must be use frequency, in other case use alphabetic order. Disabling actions: Do never remove actions. If an action is not available for an item due to its state, disable it. Exception: remove the action if the item by its nature cannot perform the action. Actions menu may have icons. Using many icons can help identifying actions. Complementary actions must together (Ex: Lock, Unlock) When one is able the complementary must be disabled. Sometimes both would be able at same time (undo / redo) Only present the actions that make sense in the context. Do not overload the menu. This doesn't mean to remove disabled items. Dropdown menu from Plus button Sometimes the plus button use in certain contexts need more than a single action. For those cases please follow the following set of rules: The left configuration suggest the user the possibility of having favorites elements. Favorites are selected in a modal window and the outcome is reflected as in the right image. Out of the favorites the order is ruled as follows: First two elements are the most used ones. The rest are displayed in alphabetical order The previous image shows a case with scrollbar to let your understand the scrollable area. Guideline: The menu must be splitted in 2 areas: Primary actions: always contain the generic actions. Example: folder. Secondary actions: are sets of actions that attend a certain category, for example: structures, document types… Secondary organization: Make a first group of favorites in case they exist. Make a second group with the rest of actions. Display a maximum of 7 actions between favorites and not favorites. Show a message to allow the user know the total number of actions inside the category. Example: “Showing 7 of 203 items” Include a More area to give access to the modal that contains the rest and the configuration of favorites. Sorting inside each group: Place first the most used Place the rest in alphabetical order. The limit of this dropdown menu is 15 actions.

Language flags People tend to have pretty strong opinions on whether flags should be used as a visual cue for indicating a language, mainly because in many parts of the world, the flag may have cultural and geographic meanings that we might not be aware of, or the flag itself isn't fully accurate to the dialects spoken in that region. While we understand that reasoning, we've found that the times they are actually needed (when a user is not familiar with the currently displayed language) somewhat eliminates using other mechanisms, such as the name of the language (since the current language could be in an entirely different character set). Given this, there is often at least some familiarity with the identity of a country that speaks a shared language. {foreach $flag in $page.flags} {$page.flagData[$flag]} ({$flag}) {/foreach} Other icon libraries Font Awesome and Glyphicons are good alternatives in case you don't want to use Lexicon icon library.

It is useful for comparing entries among them that do not need exhaustive comparison. In case you need exhaustive comparison use the table view. A list allows you a free way of displaying information. While the table isn't meant to have several text labels in a column, list is the pattern for doing that, as you can see in the following examples. Not all the element in a list entry are mandatory, feel free to delete and include the ones you need. When a list is used together with management bar, the list entries must include the checkbox, as the selection and actions are reflected in the management bar. Row states Default states Hover state Selected state Row interactions A list entry can have a checkbox, a radio or none of them. Selecting a row is only possible by using the checkbox or radio depending on the selection type desired in the list. An interaction with the background does not produce row selection. Text elements in the row can be configured as links to navigate. A row can have none or several actions associated. When there is only one action and it can be represented by an icon, you don't need to make use of the actions menu. Otherwise, use the actions menu on the right side of the row. The main text is usually used as an action: In case of: Folder: it navigates to the next level. File: it navigates to its detail view. Do never use it for preview. Preview is always a secondary action placed in the row action menu. If the link drives the user out of the site, please identify visually that this link will open in a new page. Content format and alignment Main text must be always in semibold. In order to favor legibility an easiest way to identify content within a list item, the width of the main content won’t go further than the 50% of the row on wide screens. Inside the main content group there won’t be more than three elements stacked. However, the row can grow vertically if the elements need more vertical space, but never more than two lines. In those cases when a short description is needed this would be placed, as said before, aligned on the right of the main content and will extend until the tools. This description won’t be more than two lines long. Text elements can’t fill more than two lines. In the case that a text element is longer, we will use an ellipsis. Sections List sections help to separate different contents by a certain categorization or typology. Example of use More examples can be found in dataset template. Responsive Text elements can’t fill more than two lines. Ellipsis will be used to suggest more content available when is impossible to show all in a small screen. These ellipsis won’t be actionable. They are only indicative. The whole content will be showed on the item full description state. In case a list row has tags they can’t occupy more than one line. In the case that a tags row is longer, use an ellipsis. NOTIFICATIONS PORTAL List entries may need support for notifications.

In this case thing about using a new page. Use it for simple content cases. Try not triggering a modal window from another modal window. Modal windows are subordinated to pages. Use it if you need to cut the user flow to display concrete and certain information, or if you need to capture certain data from the user. Do never blind completely the background page information.

In case this happens, make sure to provide a good experience preventing first modal closing by accidental interaction (as an example). Size Modals are always displayed at the center of the screen and can be configured in 4 different size and they are defined as table shows: | Size | Description | | ---- | ----- | | Small | 320px | | Default | 600px | | Large | 896px wide modal in window sizes greater than 992px. 600px wide modal in window sizes between 768px and 992px. | | Full width | A modal that stretches to fit the browser window with 45px padding on every side. | Attributes Modal header Title Close button Body Content: form, text, image... Footer Modal buttons Configurations Lexicon allows your modal window to have different configurations related to your needs. These needs vary from case to case and that is why not every modal in the system needs to be equal, but needs to follow certain rules. Header, body and footer This is the classic composition of a modal window with its three main parts: header, body and footer. Header and body This is the case when you don't need a footer bar to place your icons. Body and Footer This case is thought for those cases where you need to just show text and buttons to agree or cancel. iFrame in the body It is always possible to bring an iFrame inside the body. For more information about this check Clay. Modal overlay color Modal overlay color is main lighten 8% color with an alpha value of 0.8. Modals for status messages Modal headers can be configured to use modals as status messages. This solution is proposed to give more emphasis on blocking actions that the use must read and pay careful attention. Do never remove the icon in the title as it provides the modal with a better accessibility level. Use direct and concrete titles. Mobile When a modal reaches the mobile viewport size its look and feel is transformed to the one you see below offering a mobile friendly version. Modal occupies the hole screen allowing only the interaction with the modal and its content.

Color adds another layer of information that's not required for non-grouped data and only serves to confuse the user. Since only one color is used, a legend is not required. Situation 2: Grouped data Grouping data introduces an extra level of complexity to the chart. To visually separate the groups, different colors must be used for each group. All groups must have their bars in the same order, so it is easy to map the progression of a single item. Since there are many colors use to represent the group-data, a color legend is required to identify the groups.

Lexicon provides a specific color order and combinations and rules to follow when you create a new chart component, including patterns, dash lines, and shapes. Flat Colors Gradient Colors Use gradient colors when you don’t need a chart with embedded texts, but instead you need visual variation between shapes (an example could be a Heat Map). Use of Gradient Colors An example use case for gradient colors could be a low/high level Map with different data for every country, with a maximum of nine levels of differentiation. Rules for Gradient Colors You can get the same percentages we applied to the “Stark” blue for each one of the Flat Colors by using a sass color generator. Paste the Flat Color HEX, and you’ll get the percentages. This provides you with a set of colors that you can use as gradient colors. Reading colors Colors help identify data and improve readability, but they must be chosen carefully. Choosing the wrong colors can produce the opposite effect. Below are some guidelines for choosing colors are shown below. Shape & order Using the proper shape and color order helps avoid color vibration and lets users, including color blind users, easily identify chart sections. A pie chart example is shown below: Do Don't Lines Charts Only use borders, 2px thickness, to identify line charts. Differentiate them using dash types, shape types, and colors. Don’t use background/area colors with line charts, as they will only confuse the user. Area Charts Background colors may be necessary to identify Area Charts. We recommend that you use 10% opacity for each Area Chart's background color. This lets area colors overlap, without completely obscuring each other. Use the same elements as Line Charts for borders and shapes. Colors on chart interaction For clarity and to provide a good user experience, you should let the user interact and focus on single chart elements. The example below resizes the selected element (from the pie or the legend) and highlights it by decreasing the opacity of the other elements to 40%: The example below styles a Line chart to improve readability. The selected element maintains the 2px border, while the other elements are decreased to a 1px border and 40% opacity: Text embedded in area Although, you can include text inside the Flat Colors by default, we don't recommend it. Instead, we recommend that you use organization and interaction to improve text readability. The best place for this is the legend. Accessibility Lexicon provides a set of elements that you can use to improve accessibility in your charts. These are covered in more detail below. Lines and Shapes Lines and shapes can help you create easily recognizable patterns in line charts. You can see both elements in action in the example below: Area patterns You can use patterns in areas to help identify each section. Lexicon provides nine patterns you can use to differentiate areas: These patterns should be used in areas that don't overlap, such as the slices in a Pie Chart.

Grays out the remaining elements with a 40% opacity.

Interaction items Chart item This can be a bar inside a Bar Chart, a pie slice in a Pie Chart, etc. The popover must show information related to this specific item. The popover must be shown on top of the chart item. Highlight the legend item (font weight to semi-bold). This clearly communicates the relationship between the chart element and its corresponding legend value. Chart item inside a group We don't differentiate between grouped items and stand alone items. When a user interacts with an item in a set of items, the behavior is the same as a Chart Item. Axis item The popover must show information related to all the elements in that axis row or column. This information can either be global information, like a number, or an information breakdown. The popover must be shown next to the axis item without hovering the chart. Sometimes there will only be one axis. Sometimes the chart will not provide interaction on both axis. This is perfectly normal. Example: Vertical stacked bar An interaction in the x-axis item will show a popover with information for each of the items. An interaction in the y-axis item will show nothing. Legend item Highlight all items of this legend type in the chart. The popover must show information related to this specific item summary for that legend type.

Wizards Forms can be used together with wizards, so called Multi step forms. Wizards allow us to break down the form complexity into a process of smaller consecutive forms where the user can focus more its attention and that we want the user to go through. There are 2 types of wizards: Multi Step Form. Or Wizard form is used to divide the main tasks of a form in subtasks so as not to have so many information and provide a progressing completion.

Try to place first as many mandatory fields when possible to make the user task short. Non mandatory fields should go in a second place as they are not so important and the user could like to skip them. In case non mandatory fields are in between mandatory fields the user would expend more time scanning the form. Fields’ length Fields must occupy the space you expect your user needs to fill it. The only requirement for fields is to adapt their width to the grid so they behave properly on window resize. Sharp shape forms do not go against Lexicon but we prefer rectangular shape form as they look more clear. In mobile view ports field lengths should be half of the screen or full length. Mandatory fields Fields can be mandatory/required to fill in a form. The way to mark a field as mandatory is: Try to place first as many mandatory fields when possible to make the user task short. Non mandatory fields should go in a second place as they are not so important and the user may like to skip them. In case non mandatory fields are in between mandatory fields the user would expend more time scanning the form. Repeatable fields Single repeatable field Single repeable field is useful when the user must introduce several data of the same type from different inputs, no matter the number nor the order. Set of repeatable fields This allow you let the user add contents of a same type in a form. This is usually used to contribute with more form pieces that allow the user to specify more information. A set always bring the possibility to add or remove sets. See the following example: Actions General form actions General form actions always placed at the end of the form and they are always placed in same order and to the left of the form. The button size to use is default. Note: This order is reversed in modals, where buttons in the footer are right-aligned: Link, Secondary, Primary. Interior form actions Interior form actions should not be as notorious as general actions. Therefore, use the secondary button. Do's and Don'ts Do never use two primary buttons together. There must only be one primary button that represents the most important action. Do Don't Do always use concrete words rather than general as \"Ok\". Do Don't Boolean situations Boolean situations are those yes/no situations usually solved with checkboxes. Try to be always as explicit as possible to let the user know what is the outcome of the decision. Do not hide helpful information to the user in popovers, alerts, or secondary text.

Inline validation Forms have inline validation. All form fields that can be checked against a set of rules while filling them must show success or error state to the user. At least one field required It can be the case that inside a form or a fieldset only one of the input fields is required without a concrete decision on which of them must be required. In that case: Set mandatory mark in the fieldset title. It is recommended to include a short help text below the title. \"Please enter at least one of the following fields.\" All fields must be marked with the validation color as it corresponds. The only validation message is shown for just one (better the first) input in the fields group. A good help message allows the user identifying the error and how to solve it. Once the validation conditions are met, the alert message disappears. Losing focus triggers validation unless one field in the group field is focused. Full validation Forms are validated on submit action through the \"Save\" action. When a form is completely validated it will first do the partial validation of all mandatory fields.

Multi step form is most commonly used to guide the user in the process of filling a complex or a long form. Some processes may require you to navigate backwards through the process. For those cases make sure to set up links in the multi step form elements. Lexicon recommends 7 as a maximum number of steps to have for two reasons. First, because 7 is a good number of elements to remember. Second, because when reaching mobile screens is a good threshold for touch interaction. In case you need more than 7 steps they will be grouped under the 6th element in the multi step form with a dropdown menu. Each of the steps can have 3 different states: Disabled, selected or done. Use it when the task is long and/or complicated to divide it in small chunks easier to complete by the user. Use it when the user needs guidance in the process in a process that she is not familiar with. Use it when there is a specific sequence to complete steps. Make chunks that are not overwhelming. Step names must be clear, short, and express the content below them. Use two words maximum. A multi step form must have a minimum of two steps: Lexicon recommends to use a maximum of seven steps: But in case you need to implement more steps to make the process easier to your user, please follow this recommendation: Example Attributes Done: Checked page Selected: Current page Disabled: Non visited page Steps row: equally divided space between all steps. Mobile Due to the reduce space in mobile the process bar is reduced to a maximum of 5 steps.

It is very common to have the need of spliting a long list of options in several columns to reduce space. How to decide can be difficult: 1 column: It is always easier and faster to read as the eye doesn’t have to jump. Use it always when you have long descriptions. Splitting in many columns: Make sure to have really many options and to have at least 6 elements per column, otherwise there is no real benefit. Radio vs Dropdown Menu It is a common case of doubt when to use radios or a dropdown menu instead when users need to choose one item out of a list of options. There is not a fixed rule for that but we propose this guidelines. Radio buttons: When the number of options is small When options need a long label to explain the differences of each option. Radio buttons are always listed vertically. Dropdown menus: When the number of options is large, or has the potential to become large. Options should be of the same nature (e.g. a list of branches, or a list of people). Do's and Don'ts Use capital letters in text associated to a radio. Do Don't Use radio when only one option can be selected. Do Don't Toggle A toggle is an interface element that by its activation or deactivation provokes an immediate action in the screen.

Do Don't Use toogles for activation. Do Don't Use checkboxes instead of toggles in confirmation messages. Do Don't Variations Toggle with data attributes This type of toggles have labels around as the title label or other support label that make more explicit the switch value. The support label can be either at the top, right, bottom or left and its value should change with the toggle state change as the example shows. All the labels have the interaction that the switch have making the toggle more accessible. Toggle with icon Toggles can also have an icon inside the toggle circle that helps to identify the action.

When a table is used together with management bar, the table entries must include the checkbox, as the selection and actions are reflected in the management bar. You can find these examples in dataset display. The previous image points out the different elements that are covered in this page: Table header Section Row Row interaction Table header All column headers are always left-aligned, 14px, and regular weight. Table header can be interactive: Sorting (if available): the column header has an arrow next to it indicating the sort direction, A-z down arrow and Z-a up arrow. The text is underlined on hover state. Drag & drop (if available): the column header shows a drag-icon on hover state. Table header attributes Selected column Sort direction icon Rest of columns Sections Whenever you need to group series of table entries, you can use the table group separator. Row states Default state Hover state A table row in hover state show quick actions from the actions menu that can be performed on the element. A maximum of three actions that represented by icons can appear. When the row is selected the action do not appear in hover state. Selected state Row attributes Checkbox Main column text Columns Actions button Checkbox Main column text Columns Actions button Quick actions displayed on row hover Row interactions A table entry can have a checkbox, a radio or none of them. Selecting a row is only possible by using the checkbox or radio depending on the selection type desired in the table. An interaction with the background does not produce row selection. Text elements in the row can be configured as links to navigate. A row can have none or several actions associated. When there is only one action and it can be represented by an icon, you don't need to make use of the actions menu. Otherwise, use the actions menu on the right side of the row. The first column is usually used as an action: In case of: Folder: it navigates to the next level. File: it navigates to its detail view. Do never use it for preview. Preview is always a secondary action placed in the row action menu. If the link drives the user out of the site, please identify visually that this link will open in a new page. A cell entry could include a button as main action of a table entry. An example could be \"Execute\". Drag and drop is possible for moving selected elements into a folder. A click and drag over a non selected element implies selection. Row hover Row Interaction Limitation Concerning the use of the actions menu on hover there is a limitation. It is not possible to have a row with a button in the default state because it would be impossible to click on it while the actions menu is active in the hover state. Do's and Don'ts Do never hide a action in the table as both static actions in the row and quick actions are not compatible. Quick actions will always hover an action placed in the table row and it will be imposible to reach, in this example, \"Edit\" button. Do Don't Columns drag and drop Drag and drop is configurable in tables. Tables that allow drag and drop handle this action from the column header, letting the user exchange columns position except with the first one. Columns visibility Columns in a table can be shown or hidden only when the table goes together with the management bar and the management bar implements this feature. All columns can be hidden except the first one as it is the reference column. Columns layout A table contains 1 to many columns and how to place them properly can be cumbersome. We provide you a set of advices so you can take quick and easy decisions. While main column must be always placed on the leftmost side, depending on the number of columns and its content you would prefer different table layouts: 2 columns: Place the second column right next to the first column respecting the margins. N columns: Place columns equidistant. Content format and alignment Headers must be always left-aligned and semibold. First column value must be always in semibold. The rest of the columns text values must be in regular. Text values, dates, stickers, labels and badges must be always left-aligned. Numbers, with or without unit must be right-aligned.

They are used here to provide you with feedback about its height. Usage The Management Bar is always part of a bigger structure and works along with other data management patterns like tables, lists or cards, and its functionality is directly related to them. The Management Bar has two main states: State 1 It is the default state. It displays tools focused on filtering, sorting and data visualization. Checkbox: To select all elements in the current page Filter and Order: dropdown with dropdown menu associated. Please see dropdown with groups Sort toggle button: The arrow identifies the sorting order depending on the selected option inside Filter and Order dropdown. The main attribute, usually the name, states the default sort parameter. Search bar to filter out the current dataset. Visualization button to select the desired visualization. Plus button to add content and folders into the dataset. State 2 It displays contextual tools associated to specific items selected. It is only activated when one or more items from the visualization are selected. The actions of the management bar are contextualized providing only those specific actions that the selected dataset allows. The background color and the way to show the icons of the bar in this state changes to differentiate from the default state and establish a visual relation with other forms of showing this tools. Checkbox: To select all elements in the current page Counter: Selected elements counter Select all: To select all elements in the dataset Quick actions: set of quick actions with a visual representation Actions menu: on interaction displays a dropdown menu with all the actions that can be applied over the selected dataset. Requirements The Management Bar has to be fixed on the header of the page so it can be always visible during the vertical scroll. On the default state of the bar, filter and order tools have to be always on the left side and visualization and information tools on the right. On the second state, the tools for selected items appear always on the right side of the bar and vary according to the items selected. Tools shown in the Management Bar are only the ones that the type of data displayed requires it in a specific context. A user can only sort and filter by those elements that are visible in the current visualization. Example of use Selection How selection works using the management bar: State 1: A click in the checkbox, off state, selects all the elements in the current page. State 1 and 2: The checkbox is marked with a dash when the selection is partial in the whole dataset. State 2: Even if the checkbox is with a dash a click selects all elements in the page. State 2: There is a \"Select all\" that selects all elements in the dataset. State 2: Unselecting the checkbox deselects all selection done over the dataset. Filter and order A dropdown button triggers a dropdowm menu with groups. This configuration is thought to clean the management bar providing the user with more specific mechanisms to find data. Filter by: used to filter in/out elements from the dataset. Order by: used to order the dataset by one of the available attributes. In case there is no possible order or only one order this section must not appear. Group by: used to group the dataset in different ways. A title and a data provider with the different classification terms per each criteria must be provided. In case there is no group by criteria or there is only one criteria this section must not appear. Filters are reflected in the results' bar. This bar includes a label per filter applied. View change This icon button allows to change visualization among tables, lists and cards. This button must not appear if there is only one possible visualization. Search When a management bar contains a search field and it is used to filter elements, there is a thin stripe informing the user with the total number of results. This can be combined with filters. Layout Variations The functionalities that are not going to be used in the management bar disappear. So the Search field grows towards the disappearing elements, as shown below. The general exemple with all the functionalities: Some scenarios might force you to not have selection or filters. In this case you can freely remove what is not needed for your specific use case. In this example, we only need the search field, a button to change visualizations and the plus button to add elements into the dataset. Another possible scenario might not require you to have the visualizations and the plus buttons. In this case, the management bar layout will be as follows: Having the management toolbar only configured with the search field is the minimum possible configuration. Last but not least, a very common case, and aforementioned in View Case section, is to go without the visualizations button. Mobile State 1 In mobile version all actions have been transformed into icons to reduce spaces and limit the bar to only one line providing the interface with more space for content rather than tools. State 2 In contrast to the desktop version, no actions are facilitated outside the actions menu to clean the bar. Search By tapping on the magnifying glass icon button, the management bar gets into this state. The search field hovers the whole bar providing a better interaction space. Search results After tapping on intro in the search field the management bar return to state 1 with a summary line of the results found. Mobile Layout Variations When not every feature appears in the management bar, the Search field grows towards the disappeared functionality. The general case, with all the features: The dataset has only the options of changing the view mode and adding new elements which is the example below. In this case, the options of selection and filter and order are available. The dataset display in this case, only allows to Search. The most common option allows all possibilities except the way to change the view. Note: The management bar doesn't have borders. They are used here to provide you with feedback about its height.

Its height changes depending on the height of the elements it contains. The toolbar always maintains the vertical alignment. You only need to define the number of blocks or containers that you want to have in your toolbar and place the elements inside it. These blocks or containers are of 2 different types: Field: is used to make tight groups. Content: is used to span as much as possible in the rest of the space. In case there are several contents the available space is equally divided. Layout For a better understanding of the previous sections, here are some example layouts: Example 1: Three consecutive fields Example 2: Three consecutive contents Example 3: Field - Content - Field To set a better context the folling examples over the management bar will help you to understand the previous images better: Attributes The horizantal distance between elements is always 16px. This change into 8px in mobile viewports. When talking about vertical distances, the minimum will be always 16px. There is an exception of the search field that we want it to take a higher relevance and its height is 40px. In this case, the bar top and bottom margins are 12px.

When there is not enough space in the screen to make all the breadcrumbs explicit, first levels are collapsed in a dropdown allowing the user to read and navigate to the previous closer levels but also allowing to navigate to other levels in an easy way. The breadcrumb is always horizontal. Long crumbs can be reduced using ellipsis. All crumbs are links to the respective navigation level, except last crumb that is only used to identify the current page. When the crumbs reach overflow in the screen, the elements get collapsed into a dropdown menu as show below. The order of the elements inside the dropdown menu is reversed. Do's and Don'ts Do's Don'ts Only use it for hierarchical purposes. Do not use it if there is only one navigation level. Use it when navigating through folders in tables/lists.

A navbar is always horizontal and can contain one or several entry points placed from left to right. Place first the most important ones.

Please see the following example: The user is interacting with the sixth tab where the dropdown menu is open and he is hovering an entry. The has selected the option Sixth in the dropdown menu. When the user opens the dropdown menu Sixth option appears marked as selected. Once a tab is selected outside the dropdown menu, the dropdown menu tab changes its label to \"More\" as default value.
