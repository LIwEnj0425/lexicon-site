Page navigation can have different compositions but it always follows a same pattern:

1. Header (mandatory): It shoes the application name
	1. Product menu button
	2. Page / Application name
	3. Application actions as Export/Import or Permissions
2. Application sections: Use it only in case the application has more than one section.
