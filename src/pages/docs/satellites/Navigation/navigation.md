This section describes the main navigational patterns, although it is necessary to point out that there are more patterns that could produce a navigation on interaction with them.

Product navigation in DXP DE is always done through the [product menu](../Sidebar/product_menu.html). This sidebar acts as side navigation pattern and it is always placed to left side of the screen. It can be shown and hidden using the product menu icon.

Page navigation can have different compositions but it always follows a same pattern:

1. Header (mandatory): It shoes the application name
	1. Product menu button
	2. Page / Application name
	3. Application actions as Export/Import or Permissions
2. Application sections: Use it only in case the application has more than one section.
