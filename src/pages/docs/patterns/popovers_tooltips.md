## Tooltips

Tooltips are brief pieces of information that appear on hover state over an element to clarify the meaning or use of an interaction element for the user.

### Usage

* Tooltips are used with icon buttons to help understanding the metaphor they transmit.
* They can be also used with links or images.
* Tooltips are thought to contain few text. Lexicon recommends a maximum of 280 characters. In case your description is longer, please use a popover.
* The tooltip appears on hover state and disappears when hover ends. This pattern does not exist in mobile a hover is not a possible state.
* Please make a right use of the arrow positioning as it could drive to misunderstandings when it doesnâ€™t point to the correct interface element.
* When possible, try to not overlap other interaction elements in the same component.

### Attributes

* Width: 232px maximum
