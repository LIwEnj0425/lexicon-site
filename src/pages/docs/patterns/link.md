### Usage
* Use links only for navigation. A link must not trigger other kind of action.
* Do not use a link to trigger an action that could trigger a button. If this is the case use [button link](./buttons.html) type.

#### External Link

For hyperlinks that point at (target) any domain other than the domain the link exists on (source) we provide a tooltip specifying this behavior.

For accessibility purposes we also provide an icon to illustrate this behavior. This icon is visually hidden by default and only accessible on focus or when using assistive technologies such as screen readers.
