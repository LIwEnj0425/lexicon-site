### Description

{$page.description}

### Usage

* Use this pattern only for image selection.
* The elements placed in the grid must be of any image type that can display a previsualization in the form of a thumbnail.
* Simple and multiple selection must be possible.
    * Single selection closes the modal on image selection.
    * Multiple selection allows to select as many images wanted and the modal is closed with modal “Done” button.
* Hovering an image allows to see its title name. Long titles have ellipsis in the middle allowing to see the end of the title to differentiate between image versions.
    * Image titles are always shown in touch interfaces.
