## Selector

![select default state](../../../images/Selector.jpg)

### Usage

This pattern is completely different from a dropdown. A selector is a native component with a data provider. A dropdown, however, opens a panel that could contain multiple and different natural elements.

### States

The states for a selector are the same as the states for a text input.


## Multi select
Multi select is the field type that allows writing text to create “tags” that are represented in the shape of labels. This components counts with auto complete feature.
