## Select

{$page.description}

![select default state](../../../images/Selector.png)


### Usage

This pattern is completely different from a dropdown as a select is a native component with a data provider. A dropdown, instead, opens a panel where the panel could contain multiple and different nature elements.

### States

The states for a select are the same as for a text input.

## Multiple select

Select button used to select more than one option from a simple list.
