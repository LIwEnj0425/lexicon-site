## Selector

{$page.description}

![selector default state](../../../images/Selector.png)

### Usage

This pattern is completely different from a dropdown as a selector is a native element with a list asociated. A dropdown instead opens a panel where the panel could contain multiple different things.

### States

#### Default

![selector default state](../../../images/Selector.png)

#### Active

![selector active state](../../../images/Selector+Focus.png)

#### Disabled

![selector disabled state](../../../images/Selector+Disabled.png)


## Multiple selector

Select button used to select more than one option from a simple list.
