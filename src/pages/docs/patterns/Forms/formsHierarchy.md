This page contemplates the visual definition of the hierarchy, the measurements and the definition of the components that establish that hierarchy 

### Layout

There are defined three main elements to define the form hierarchy:
1. Form title
2. First level section header. This one can be either:
    1. The header of a fixed section
    2. The header of a collapsible section
3. Second level section header

You can see all these elements coexisting in the same form structure in the following examples:

Including examplanatory texts:

### Attributes

Metrics definition is important to understand how forms are build and the vertical spacing logic work in our forms.

#### Desktop

As it’s explained in the [grid section](../../designPrinciples/grid.html), the main vertical spacing reference is 24px.
