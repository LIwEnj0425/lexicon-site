### Left navigation menu

A left navigation menu allow us to break down the complexity of a form into many and more simple forms. A good rule to divide forms is context.
When using a left navigation menu, it is pretty important to identify the form title with the same name the menu item has.

### Wizards

Forms can be used together with wizards, so called Multi step forms. Wizards allow us to break down the form complexity into **a process** of smaller consecutive forms where the user can focus more its attention and that **we want the user to go through**.

There are 2 types of wizards:
* Multi Step Form. Or Wizard form is used to divide the main tasks of a form in subtasks so as not to have so many information and provide a progressing completion. See more about [Multi Steps Forms](./multiStepForm.html)

* Multi Step form Simplified is used as a progressive disclosure method to let the user know where he/she is. Example of Multi Step form **used in a Modal**. Visit [Multi Step Form Simplified](./multiStepFormSimplified.html) to have more information.
