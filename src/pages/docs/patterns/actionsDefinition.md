### Delete vs Send to Recycle Bin

#### Delete

The action of deleting an element or a set of elements implies that it is not possible to recover them from anywhere and they will disappear forever. This icon can be also used for clearing actions like clear an input field content.

As this is a strong action, you must trigger the user with a confirmation message, always native and not styled by Lexicon.

<div class="row">
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
        <img class="do" src="../../../images/Delete.jpg" alt="delete icon">
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</div>
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="dont" src="../../../images/Trash.jpg" alt="trash icon">
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</div>
		<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="dont" src="../../../images/Cancel.jpg" alt="cancel icon">
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</div>
</div>


#### Send to Recycle Bin

The action of sending to recycle bin implies that recovering the element is possible. Therefore, it doesn't imply a complete removal of the element.

<div class="row">
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
        <img class="do" src="../../../images/Trash.jpg" alt="trash icon">
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</div>
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="dont" src="../../../images/Delete.jpg" alt="delete icon">
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</div>
		<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="dont" src="../../../images/Cancel.jpg" alt="cancel icon">
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</div>
</div>

#### Cancel

Cancel and close differ much from deleting or sending to the Recycle Bin. This action can be found in modals at the top right corner. 

<div class="row">
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
        <img class="do" src="../../../images/Cancel.jpg" alt="cancel icon">
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</div>
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="dont" src="../../../images/Delete.jpg" alt="delete icon">
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</div>
		<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="dont" src="../../../images/Trash.jpg" alt="trash icon">
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</div>
</div>


### Done

Use it as the primary button copy in all modal that display a table / list  / card view to select one or several elements.

<div class="row">
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="do" src="../../../images/FormButtonPrimaryTextDo.jpg" alt="Primary button with text Done">
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</div>
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="dont" src="../../../images/FormButtonPrimaryTextDont.jpg" alt="Primary button with text Ok">
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</div>
</div>

### Select vs Choose

The convention in Lexicon is to use **Select** instead of Choose, as Select is a more formal word.

Select means "to carefully choose"; it also means "to use a mouse or keystrokes to mark something on a computer screen". Therefore, Choose can not have the implication we want on interaction design.

<div class="row">
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="do" src="../../../images/ActionsSelectDo.jpg" alt="Secondary button with text Select">
		<p class="do">Do</p>
	</div>
	<div class="dodont col-lg">
		<img class="dont" src="../../../images/ActionsSelectDont.jpg" alt="Secondary button with text Choose">
		<p class="dont">Don't</p>
	</div>
</div>
