### Description

{$page.description}

![vertical navigation nested levels open](../../../images/NavigationVerticalOpen.png)

### Usage

This pattern is always vertical and placed to the left of the form allowing the navigation between different pages/forms. Normally, this navigation pattern is used in lower navigation levels to reach the lowest level pages.

This pattern is used in form templates. Remember *Lexicon recommends* to split long forms into smaller forms to make task easier. Therefore, this navigation pattern is needed to access the different forms.


### Mobile

In mobile devices the navigation is translated into a full-width collapsible menu displayed right before the form. When this menu opens it never pushes down the content, it is displayed over the form.
