### Usage

This pattern is used in form templates. Remember *Lexicon recommmends* to split long forms into smaller forms to make easier the task. Therefore, this navigation pattern is needed to access the different forms.

Attributes:
* The selected option is marked in semibold.

### Mobile

In mobile devices the navigation is translated into a dropdown menu.
