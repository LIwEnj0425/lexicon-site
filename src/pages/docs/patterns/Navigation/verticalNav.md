### Description

{$page.description}

![nested navigation nested levels open](../../../images/NavigationVerticalOpen.png)

### Usage

This pattern is always vertical and placed to the left of the form allowing the navigation between different pages. Normally this navigation pattern is used in lower navigation levels to reach the lowest level pages.

This pattern is used in form templates. Remember *Lexicon recommends* to split long forms into smaller forms to make easier the task. Therefore, this navigation pattern is needed to access the different forms.

Attributes:
* The selected option is marked in semibold.

### Mobile

In mobile devices the navigation is translated into a dropdown menu.
