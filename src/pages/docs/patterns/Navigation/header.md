### Usage

Header is always fixed to the top of the window.

This header is used in almost every page in the system. It can have different configurations as you can see in the following examples. But it has a common configuration:
* Left area: Used for actions as triggering the side menu and back navigation
* Center area: Used for the page or application title and help
* Right area: Used for actions, explicit when it is possible and a maximum number of 3. Implicit inside a kebab menu when the metaphor is not clear.
    * These actions are application level actions.
