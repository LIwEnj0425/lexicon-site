### Usage

### Variations

#### Header for DE

This header is used in almost every page in the system. It can have different configurations as you can see in the following examples. But it has a common configuration:
* Left area: Used for actions as triggering the side menu and back navigation
* Center area: Used for the page or application title and help
* Right area: Used for actions, explicit when it is possible and a maximum number of 3. Implicit inside a kebab menu when the metaphor is not clear.
