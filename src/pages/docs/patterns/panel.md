* Do not nest a panel inside another panel.

### Variations

#### Accordion

Panels can be collapsible. Whenever there is a collapsible panel the header must include a disclosure icon as an affordance to let the user understand that open and close actions can be performed. Accordions do no autoclose when another one is open.

It is not a good practice to anidate accordions. Please try to avoid it.
