The measurement points are ordered (typically by their x-axis value) and joined with straight line segments. A line chart is often used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time – a time series – thus the line is often drawn chronologically.

Line charts can also be used to compare changes over the same period of time for more than one group.

### Color use

In the case of Line Chart you must follow the same color order defined for charts. Each graph will have one different color,but different line types and shapes for markers so as to easily differentiate each of them.

### Pattern use

[Patterns](./charts.html), both line type and shape type, are of free use. They provide a better accessibility for your disabled users. But it is up to you to decide when to use them.
