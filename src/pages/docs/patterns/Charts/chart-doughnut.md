### Description

{$page.description}

We recommend you to use the Doughnut chart instead of the Pie chart due to:
* When you first see the Pie Chart the eyes tend to be attracted to the center of the pie, then to the outside circle, and only after that the different parts of the chart. 
* When you first see the Doughnut Chart thereâ€™s no center to be attracted to and the eyes can read the different parts of the chart easily.
