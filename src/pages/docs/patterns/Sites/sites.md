Building well structured sites also matters to Lexicon. Well structured widgets with a good information architecture definition help consuming and understanding data in a faster way. In this section, we cover the widget structure, as a pattern used by all our Asset Display Templates (ADTs), different smaller patterns that are used in multiple ADTs, and the different ADTs for you to understand how they are built and configured.

![ADT example marking different points: 1. Widget Title bar, 2. Asset tittle bar, 3. Profile info, 4. Asset Toolbar, 5. Buttons](../../../images/sites/SitesExample.jpg)

Further information for each of the components can be found in dedicated pages:
1. [Widget Title Bar](../widgetTitleBar.html)
2. [Asset Title Bar](../assetTitleBar.html)
3. [Profile Info](../profileInfo.html)
4. [Asset Toolbar](../assetToolbar.html)
5. [Buttons](../buttons.html)

Each ADT can be very different but all of them share a same structure not being mandatory the use of any of the elements previously described, but sharing a same look and feel.

In a near future more examples will be brought to this section.
