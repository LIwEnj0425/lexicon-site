### Variations

#### Primary button icon + text

Primary buttons with icon and text can be used either in logged or not logged environments.

**Active**

![Button Primary Icon plus Text active state](../../../images/sites/ButtonSitesPrimaryIconTextActive.png)


#### Secondary button icon + text

On the one hand we have the button with icon and text. This button is an extension of Lexicon's secondary button and is built based on the styles of this one. In this way they can be regular or without borders.

**Default**

![Button site default and button site default borderless](../../../images/sites/ButtonSitesDefault.png)

**Hover**

![Button site hover and button site hover borderless](../../../images/sites/ButtonSitesHover.png)

**Active**

![Button site active and button site active borderless](../../../images/sites/ButtonSitesActive.png)

These buttons would appear normally as triggers of actions and tools as a part of the [Asset Toolbar](./assetToolbar.html) element.

#### Secondary blue buttons

On the other hand we have a type of button that appears only when the user is logged in and has editing permissions on the portlets and their content. These buttons are built following the same pattern of the Secondary Button but using the blue as a distinctive color.

**Default**

![Button site default and button site default borderless](../../../images/sites/ButtonSitesBlueDefault.png)

**Hover**

![Button site hover and button site hover borderless](../../../images/sites/ButtonSitesBlueHover.png)

**Active**

![Button site active and button site active borderless](../../../images/sites/ButtonSitesBlueActive.png)


When these buttons are associated with an asset, a blog entry, a knowledge base article or a comment will only appear when hovering over the item to which it is associated. More information about this behavior can be found on the [Asset Title Bar documentation](./assetTitleBar.html).
