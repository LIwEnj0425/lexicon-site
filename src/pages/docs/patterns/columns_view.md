### Description

{$page.description}

### Usage

#### When to use it

Columns view is a good pattern to navigate through dictionaries being able to see and create categories in a fast way. But it can fit well in other scenarios when just the visualization is necessary to know the depth of the tree or discover elements at different levels.

#### When must not use it

Do not use this pattern if you need to show information further from the item title.
