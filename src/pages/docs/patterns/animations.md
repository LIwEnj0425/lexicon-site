### Description

{$page.description}

### Usage

Lexicon provides different types of animation for certain purposes. We use these animations as a message support but we never use them alone without any clarification. Specific examples can be found in [dataset display](./datasetdisplay.html).

#### Empty collection

![satellite navigating in the space](../../../images/empty_state.gif)

The satallite expreses that the dataset is empty not being anything the collection.
Use this animation when your initial dataset is empty or a folder is empty.

#### Empty search

![satellite navigating in the space](../../../images/search_state.gif)

The telescope represents the idea of looking for something in the space a nothing has been found.
Use this animation for empty search results or empty results on while applying filters over a data set. 

#### Succesful empty state

![satellite navigating in the space](../../../images/success_state.gif)

The spaceship taking off represents a successful state.
Use this animation when a list has been emptied that worths to celebrate this state. For example, when a notifications list gets emptied.
