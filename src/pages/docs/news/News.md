### Sites 

A full set of components inside [sites section](../patterns/Sites/sites.html) is already available to build you own site widgets. This will allow you to transform old widgets into new ones towards looking for a better information architecture, structure, and refreshing design.

### Layouts and Form Hierarchy 

As part of the improvement in Lexicon we want to clearly defined the different layout possibilities the we usually find in admin pages. Layout is part of our design principles as it belong to a series of principles to start builing interfaces with our system.

Forms are now better definied as the [hierarchy](../patterns/Forms/formsHierarchy.html) is expressed in a dedicated page. [Slider](../patterns/Forms/slider.html) has been defined also inside Forms section.

### Charts and Sites

Charts and Sites have been documented at their initial stage.

[Charts](../patterns/Charts/charts.html) is a totally new pattern in Lexicon and with it we want to provide you a full set of principles related to it to improve accessibility, preception and interpretation.

[Sites](../patterns/Sites/sites.html) tackles widgets for sites. Lexicon faces a huge improvement in this area towards improving not only the visual aspect but also the usability in some of our ADTs. Many improvements will come in upcoming dates in this area towards next portal release.
