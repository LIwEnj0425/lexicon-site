**Dropdown menu:**

[Dropdown menu](../pattern/dropdowns.html) definition has been update to accept icons on the left side of actions.

### Management bar update

We are happy to announce that we have a new update for the management toolbar. This toolbar is now able to contextualize actions depending on the selection done in the dataset. In this way, we want to reduce the number of errors not allowing users to perform actions that do not affect to all selected elements.
Moreover, we introduce the results bar when filters are applied and/or search is performed from the management toolbar. This helps the user with useful and visible feedback.

### Examples

Lexicon can be use to create many different interfaces. Today we open a new section "Examples" in our site to show case different interface examples created by Liferay UX designers for our products using Lexicon. We hope these series of examples inspire you on how to create your interfaces. With the time, the number of examples will grow to show you a wide variety of interfaces built with Lexicon.

### New organization

A new organization has been done in the site in relation to the components. Now components are divided in two big groups: Core and Satellite.

* **Core components** are the basic components and widely used components by differnet Liferay products.
* **Satellite components** host all other components that are not so used in many Liferay products. It still worths to have them documented here so you get more out of Liferay without having to reinvent the wheel everytime you need a new pattern. You can just come here and check if what different Liferay teams are doing solve your scenario.

It is important to highlight that core components are implemented and supported by Clay, while satellites don't.

We have also separated **Templates**, where we include the most common templates created with Lexicon components in Liferay products.

### Predictive forecast chart

[Predicitive forecast chart](../patterns/Charts/chart-forecast.html) has been documented inside the charts section. This chart is very benefitial in use cases as commerce.

### Stable version

We are glad to announce that Lexicon has moved out from beta version to a stable version.
We also want to highlight the improvements done from last release:
* The site has been adjusted to adopt the system font like we do in Lexicon.
* All images has been changed to adapt the typography form Source Sans Pro to San Francisco (system font for MacOS)
* A large number of patterns now include attributes sections where the patten anatomy is described.
* Examples have been added to many of our patterns and also descriptions have been reviewed.

Moreover, now you can find our sketch library under [resources](../resouces/index.html) section to build your own interfaces using Lexicon.

### Beta release

We are glad to announce that we are on beta right now. We will update style changes, already compromised, before leaving beta status.

<time>April 20th, 2018</time>

### General Update

This update comes with many tiny improvements that allow us to communicate better:
* Charts: base layer interaction and different chart examples
* Forms: re-organized for better understanding
* Animations: pending to include the real animation. But a first introduction is there as reference.
* Labels: patterns have labelled to know if they are implemented by Clay or they are owned by any other team/application.
* Status table: to know in what status the design and implementation is.

### General Update

This update comes with many tiny improvements that allow us to communicate better:
* Do's and Don'ts have been included for several patterns as: badges, labels, table, actions definition and popover. This provides us with a more graphic way of defining examples.
* Multiple step form now includes an example to understand how the pattern is build in an use case.
* Text input localizable has been released.
* Card layout has been added inside layouts at Foundation.
* Vertical navigation has been updated with an example of collapsible menu in mobile.
* Sidebar documentation has been splitted in several pages for a better documentation purpose focusing on special needs.

### Examples 

Examples of use have been added into table to make more clear the row hover action with images on what can be done or not. Moreover, multistep form has been updated with a layout example in a form to better understand how it must be applied. Last but not least, checkbox groups and radio groups examples with metrix have been offered.

<time>January 3rd, 2018</time>

### Sites 

A full set of components inside [sites section](../patterns/Sites/sites.html) is already available to build you own site widgets. This will allow you to transform old widgets into new ones towards looking for a better information architecture, structure, and refreshing design.

<time>November 28th, 2017</time>

### Layouts and Form Hierarchy 

As part of the improvement in Lexicon we want to clearly defined the different layout possibilities the we usually find in admin pages. Layout is part of our foundations as it belong to a series of principles to start builing interfaces with our system.

Forms are now better definied as the [hierarchy](../patterns/Forms/formsHierarchy.html) is expressed in a dedicated page. [Slider](../patterns/Forms/slider.html) has been defined also inside Forms section.

<time>November 20th, 2017</time>

### Charts and Sites

Charts and Sites have been documented at their initial stage.

[Charts](../patterns/Charts/charts.html) is a totally new pattern in Lexicon and with it we want to provide you a full set of principles related to it to improve accessibility, preception and interpretation.

[Sites](../patterns/Sites/sites.html) tackles widgets for sites. Lexicon faces a huge improvement in this area towards improving not only the visual aspect but also the usability in some of our ADTs. Many improvements will come in upcoming dates in this area towards next portal release.

### Updates

Liferay is happy to announce a new version of Lexicon in alpha state. This Lexicon Evolution brings you a wider range of possibilities, new components and brand new color palette. Lexicon now worries more about accessibility, shorter interactions, and ways to achieve a better user experience never seen before in Liferay.

This alpha version will become into beta as soon as Lexicon and Clay aligns.
