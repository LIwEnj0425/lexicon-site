## Updates

Liferay is happy to announce a new version of Lexicon in alpha state. This Lexicon Evolution brings you a wider range of possibilities, new components and brand new color palette. Lexicon now worries more about accessibily, shorter interactions, and ways to achieve a better uxer experience never seen before in Liferay.

This alpha version will become into beta as soon as Lexicon and Clay aligns.
