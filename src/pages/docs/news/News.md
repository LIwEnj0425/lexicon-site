### Charts and Sites

Charts and Sites have been documented at their initial stage.

Chats is a totally new pattern in Lexicon and with it we want to provide you a full set of principles related to it to improve accessibility, preception and interpretation.

Sites tackles widgets for sites. Lexicon faces a huge improvement in this area towards improving not only the visual aspect but also the usability in some of our ADTs. Many improvements will come in upcoming dates in this area towards next portal release.
