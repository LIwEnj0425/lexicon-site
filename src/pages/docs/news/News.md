<time>October 13th, 2018</time>

### General update

**Examples:**

As promised, we are updating the examples section. This time we bring you an example from [Liferay Partner Portal](../examples/partnerPortal.html) submitted by Patrick Pentz.

**Dropdown menu:**

[Dropdown menu](../pattern/dropdowns.html) definition has been updated to accept icons on the left side of actions.

**Tabs:**

[Tabs](../pattern/tabs.html) have been updated with an example to give context in tab bars.

### Management bar update

We are happy to announce that we have a new update for the Management Toolbar. The Toolbar is now able to contextualize actions based on the selection in the dataset. This reduces the number of potential errors by narrowing the actions down to only the ones that are relevant to the selected elements.
Moreover, we introduce the results bar when filters are applied and/or search is performed from the Management Toolbar. This provides the user with useful and visible feedback.

### Examples

Lexicon can be used to create many different interfaces. Today, we open a new "Examples" section in our site to showcase different Lexicon interface examples created by Liferay UX designers for our products. We hope these series of examples inspire you and give you an idea of the possible interfaces you can create. These examples will grow over time to showcase a wide variety of interfaces built with Lexicon.

### New organization

Components are now organized into two key groups: Core and Satellite.

* **Core components** are the basic components that are widely used by Liferay products.
* **Satellite components** are the remaining components that are not used that often in many Liferay products. Although these components are not as widely used, they can save you time from reinventing the wheel.

**Note:** that core components are implemented and supported by Clay, while satellite components are not supported.

We have also created a **Templates** section that includes the most common templates created with Lexicon components in Liferay products.

### Predictive Forecast Chart

[Predicitive Forecast Chart](../patterns/Charts/chart-forecast.html) has been documented inside the charts section. This chart is very useful for commerce data.

### Stable version

We are glad to announce that Lexicon has moved out from beta version to a stable version.
We also want to highlight the improvements done from last release:
* The site has been adjusted to adopt the system font like we do in Lexicon.
* All images has been changed to adapt the typography form Source Sans Pro to San Francisco (system font for MacOS)
* A large number of patterns now include attributes sections where the patten anatomy is described.
* Examples have been added to many of our patterns and also descriptions have been reviewed.

Moreover, now you can find our sketch library under [resources](../resouces/index.html) section to build your own interfaces using Lexicon.

### Beta release

We are glad to announce that we are on beta right now. We will update style changes, already compromised, before leaving beta status.

<time>April 20th, 2018</time>

### General Update

This update comes with many tiny improvements that allow us to communicate better:
* Charts: base layer interaction and different chart examples
* Forms: re-organized for better understanding
* Animations: pending to include the real animation. But a first introduction is there as reference.
* Labels: patterns have labelled to know if they are implemented by Clay or they are owned by any other team/application.
* Status table: to know in what status the design and implementation is.

### General Update

This update comes with many tiny improvements that allow us to communicate better:
* Do's and Don'ts have been included for several patterns as: badges, labels, table, actions definition and popover. This provides us with a more graphic way of defining examples.
* Multiple step form now includes an example to understand how the pattern is build in an use case.
* Text input localizable has been released.
* Card layout has been added inside layouts at Foundation.
* Vertical navigation has been updated with an example of collapsible menu in mobile.
* Sidebar documentation has been splitted in several pages for a better documentation purpose focusing on special needs.

### Examples 

Examples of use have been added into table to make more clear the row hover action with images on what can be done or not. Moreover, multistep form has been updated with a layout example in a form to better understand how it must be applied. Last but not least, checkbox groups and radio groups examples with metrix have been offered.

<time>January 3rd, 2018</time>

### Sites 

A full set of components inside [sites section](../patterns/Sites/sites.html) is already available to build you own site widgets. This will allow you to transform old widgets into new ones towards looking for a better information architecture, structure, and refreshing design.

### Layouts and Form Hierarchy 

As part of the improvement in Lexicon we want to clearly defined the different layout possibilities the we usually find in admin pages. Layout is part of our foundations as it belong to a series of principles to start builing interfaces with our system.

Forms are now better definied as the [hierarchy](../patterns/Forms/formsHierarchy.html) is expressed in a dedicated page. [Slider](../patterns/Forms/slider.html) has been defined also inside Forms section.

<time>November 20th, 2017</time>

### Charts and Sites

Charts and Sites have been documented at their initial stage.

[Charts](../patterns/Charts/charts.html) is a totally new pattern in Lexicon and with it we want to provide you a full set of principles related to it to improve accessibility, preception and interpretation.

[Sites](../patterns/Sites/sites.html) tackles widgets for sites. Lexicon faces a huge improvement in this area towards improving not only the visual aspect but also the usability in some of our ADTs. Many improvements will come in upcoming dates in this area towards next portal release.

### Updates

Liferay is happy to announce a new version of Lexicon in alpha state. This Lexicon Evolution brings you a wider range of possibilities, new components and brand new color palette. Lexicon now worries more about accessibility, shorter interactions, and ways to achieve a better user experience never seen before in Liferay.

This alpha version will become into beta as soon as Lexicon and Clay aligns.
